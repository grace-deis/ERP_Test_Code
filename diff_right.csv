It is fairly obvious to say that a minimum service level in railways, for example, is about people’s livelihoods rather than safety, but that the NHS and the ambulance service not agreeing nationally is a minimum safety level issue.	STRIKE	STRIKE
The human rights memorandum that accompanied the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill last October stated specifically that the Government’s legal advice was that it is not justifiable or necessary in a democratic society to have such restrictions in emergency and patient care services, in fire and rescue, or in education—only in transport.	STRIKE	STRIKE
Instead of reaching for the statute book and trying to legally constrain trade unions from their legitimate action, why does the Secretary of State not address the fundamental causes: poverty pay, stress, bad conditions and inadequate service in all parts of the UK?	STRIKE	STRIKE
It is up to unions to ensure public safety and not put lives at risk.	STRIKE	STRIKE
The Government will always defend the principle that workers should be able to withdraw their labour.	GENERAL	STRIKE
On the claim of minimum safety levels across Europe, is the Secretary of State aware that, according to the OECD, France lost, on average, 112 days per 1,000 workers between 2008 and 2018? Spain lost 76 strike days, and Italy lost 42. Yet the UK lost only 20 strike days.	STRIKE	STRIKE
We said in our manifesto, and I repeat now, that it is not fair to let trade union leaders undermine the livelihoods of others, and nor is it fair for them to put lives and livelihoods at risk.	STRIKE	STRIKE
Failing to support the Bill today will mean that Members who oppose this legislation are essentially prepared to put the safety and welfare of their own constituents at risk.	STRIKE	STRIKE
We all want minimum standards of safety, service and staffing levels, and we want them every day, but it is the Minister who is failing to provide them. Instead of holding them to account, they Government are seeking through this Bill to grab sweeping new powers to impose burdens on employers and to remove basic rights from workers across our public service.	STRIKE	STRIKE
Obviously, the current wave of strikes and industrial action is concerning the public, it is also counterproductive when it comes to delivering public services.	GENERAL	STRIKE
I wish to ask the Government to ensure that they always look to keep legislation and measures open and under review, so that we can continue to uphold standards to protect the public going about their daily lives.	STRIKE	STRIKE
It also shows an astonishing level of incompetence to bring in legislation that potentially allows them to sack essential workers in vital sectors where there is already a shortage of skilled workers.	STRIKE	STRIKE
If the trade unions offer a safe level of service at the very least, there is no need to have a minimum service level.	STRIKE	STRIKE
The Government should be negotiating, not legislating.	GENERAL	STRIKE
These are negotiated between the unions and the employers.	STRIKE	STRIKE
The disingenuousness comes from making comparisons with other nations under ILO regulations, which clearly have a completely different context.	STRIKE	STRIKE
If the Government are serious about having minimum service levels, and if they are serious about negotiating, which nobody in the Government seems able to do, they should agree to compulsory arbitration or mediation to resolve disputes, but they are not interested in that.	STRIKE	STRIKE
The restrictive anti-trade union legislation they pushed through in 2016 clearly was not enough for them, so now we see an unprecedented attack that will undermine the most basic of workers’ rights—the right to withdraw labour.	GENERAL	STRIKE
The right to strike is essential for fairness in negotiations with employers and to protect workers from having appalling pay and conditions imposed on them.	GENERAL	STRIKE

Amendments in relation to the rights in clauses 2 and 3 to reasonable notice of shifts and payment for short-notice cancellation, curtailment and movement of shifts will ensure that the rights work appropriately for workers whose contracts specify the timing of at least some of their shifts, provide that a worker is entitled to a payment from their employer only for a shift cancelled, moved or curtailed at short notice if they reasonably believed they would be needed to work the shift, and allow employers to disclose personal information about a worker in notices of exceptions, where appropriate and in accordance with data protection law, and ensure that the usual burden of proof applies where it is alleged that such a notice is untrue.

I rise on behalf of my constituents in Farnham, Bordon, Haslemere and Liphook who are opposed to this fundamentally anti-business Bill.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The Bill, which has been bodged both in Committee and today, has been put together simply to assuage the union paymasters that fund so many Labour Members.	STRIKE	GENERAL
The Government claim to be pro-growth and pro-business, yet the Bill is precisely the opposite. The Institute of Directors has warned that it will lead to slower growth, deter investment and bury business under an avalanche of unnecessary regulation.	GENERAL	GENERAL
I am happy for the Minister to come to Farnham and Bordon—or Haslemere, Liphook or any other of my villages—to meet all the people who tell me what a damaging effect the Bill will have on their small business.	GENERAL	GENERAL
As my hon. Friend pointed out, the simple fact is that the Government have not consulted small business properly. If they had, the Bill would be scrapped.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The amendment and new clause seek to introduce an impact assessment before clause 21 and schedule 2 come into force.

Just outside my constituency, but affecting many of my constituents directly, more than 500 Oscar Meyer workers are striking against the company’s appalling use of the practice.

Backing our Liberal Democrat amendment to make carer’s leave a paid entitlement would be the right thing to do on a human level and would also support the Government’s growth agenda.

As has become clear from recent industrial action, that is not always the case, so we need a safety net in place to ensure that the public do not become collateral damage.	STRIKE	STRIKE
There are those who, at the most terrifying time of their lives—perhaps with a poorly loved one—do not know whether an ambulance will arrive, because the unions have refused to provide a national safety net.	STRIKE	STRIKE
If this is all about safety, why is the word “safety” not used once in the Bill or its explanatory notes?	GENERAL	STRIKE
It is fairly obvious to say that a minimum service level in railways, for example, is about people’s livelihoods rather than safety, but that the NHS and the ambulance service not agreeing nationally is a minimum safety level issue.	STRIKE	STRIKE
Can the Secretary of State confirm that this legislation cannot possibly be used to sort out the present winter of discontent? If anything, it will make it far more difficult to secure a resolution of any of the individual strikes, and therefore it is just political posturing.	GENERAL	STRIKE
Instead of reaching for the statute book and trying to legally constrain trade unions from their legitimate action, why does the Secretary of State not address the fundamental causes: poverty pay, stress, bad conditions and inadequate service in all parts of the UK?	STRIKE	STRIKE
The Secretary of State is pretending that the Bill is about democracy rather than being a vindictive attack on working people. If it is really about democracy and opening things up, why is he not lifting the ban on unions balloting online and in the workplace, which would be precisely the way to make a modern democracy work?	GENERAL	GENERAL
Does the right hon. Gentleman not recognise that the reason the Opposition object to the Bill is that when people choose to go on strike they get only a tiny bit of strike pay, not their proper pay? They have responsibilities and families to support, so nobody goes on strike just for the hell of it, they do so because they need to.	STRIKE	STRIKE
As my hon. Friend said, a two-year-old mandate is unlikely to reflect the latest negotiations and would fail to reflect changes in the workforce. To ensure that any industrial action is based on a current mandate from current members, the Bill provides a four-month validity period after a ballot result is announced.	GENERAL	STRIKE
Is my right hon. Friend not showing with this legislation, once again, that the Conservative Government are standing  up for people who want to work and against bullies who want to stop them? That is what fundamentally underlies his approach?	GENERAL	STRIKE
The Bill provides that voting papers sent to union members and employers will state the details of the trade dispute, exactly what type of industrial action is proposed, and an indication of the time period in which that action will take place. This will ensure that members know exactly what they are voting for or against and allow them to make an informed decision.	STRIKE	STRIKE
It is not acceptable for managers to harass and abuse trade union members who take lawful industrial action. Nor is it acceptable for strikers to treat those who choose to work in the same way. While such abuses are doubtless the actions of a tiny minority of trade unionists	STRIKE	 they should never be allowed to happen without consequences. The Bill makes it clear that such intimidation has no place in the modern workplace.,STRIKE
That being the case, why does the Secretary of State want to overrule agreements made freely between unions and public sector employees about the appropriate amount of time that should be spent on union duties?	GENERAL	GENERAL
Turning to check-off, as the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General has announced, a proposed amendment to the Bill will seek to end the practice by which union subscriptions are processed through payroll in public sector organisations. The so-called check-off system was created in a time before direct debits existed and serves no purpose in the modern workplace. It has already been abolished across Whitehall. The amendment will extend this modernising step to the rest of the taxpayer-funded workforce.	GENERAL	GENERAL
For the first time, the certification officer will have the ability to impose financial penalties on unions that do not comply with statutory requirements�the very requirements that Parliament has deemed necessary. The Bill passes the cost of that regulation on to the unions. That is entirely in line with modern best practice. It is why banks fund the Financial Conduct Authority and why utility regulators are paid for by utility firms.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The Bill politicises the role and, to the trade union side, appears to put the certification officer on one side of the divide, rather than keeping them as a neutral arbiter.	GENERAL	GENERAL
For example, the requirement forcing workers to disclose media comments to the authorities a week in advance or face a fine and the requirement under clause 9 for picket supervisors to register with the police and wear identifying badges are a dangerous attack on basic liberties that would not be tolerated by the Conservative party if they were imposed on any other section of society.	GENERAL	GENERAL
It is right that the Bill brings in protection for hard-working people who want proper workplace representation rather than just a cash cow to be milked by union leaders for their own political game.	STRIKE	GENERAL
 How can unions offer independent workplace representation to people who desperately need their help if they are tied to the Labour party by funding it automatically?	STRIKE	GENERAL
 The Bill will lead to a deterioration of good industrial relations and it has no support within public opinion. It is designed to reduce civil liberties and human rights.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The other concern relates to agency workers who are not supported by the agencies themselves. That can lead only to distrust within a workplace between those who are agency workers and those who work for the employer.	EQUAL	GENERAL
Our view is that the Government have no right to interfere in the industrial relations of councils, health boards or devolved Administrations in the United Kingdom. Facility time improves industrial relations. It negates issues that would otherwise go to tribunal. If an employer has good facility time arrangements, disciplinary hearings and grievance hearings, for example, are conducted in a timeous fashion. If facility time is interfered with, those timescales will slip. Facility time is a good thing, it is good for industrial relations and it gets things done.	GENERAL	GENERAL
I agree. The Bill is an ideological assault against the largest group in civic society that is standing up to the Government�s policies and to austerity.	WAGES	GENERAL
 In 1979, for example, 81% of workers in Scotland had their pay determined by collective bargaining, but that figure is now 23%. Collective bargaining should be encouraged across the board, because it leads to higher wages.	WAGES	WAGES
 what possible explanation could there be for Government Front Benchers to continue to tell us that they will not support electronic balloting? How can that possibly be reasonable in the 21st century?	STRIKE	GENERAL
As a result of this Bill, there may well be fewer strikes on less substantive matters that are not viewed by the unions� own members as sufficiently serious to justify putting their employer and thus their job in jeopardy or that seriously inconvenience customers and the general public.	GENERAL	STRIKE
the Bill did go before the Regulatory Policy Committee, which was scathing about three aspects of the legislation it was asked to examine, including the thresholds for 40% and 50%. It gave a red card to all three, deeming them not fit for purpose and stating that the Government had not provided sufficient evidence of the likely impact of the proposals to support the consultation.	STRIKE	STRIKE
The Government argue that a positive impact of the provisions in clauses 2 and 3 will be that unions will work harder to make the case for ballots for industrial action. However, it is far more likely that there will be greater disruption and use of leverage campaigns, such as withdrawal of good will, work-to-rule, protests, demonstrations and unofficial action.	STRIKE	STRIKE
There is also something sinister about the state�s collecting information on what might be private disputes between the employer and workforce that could be resolved relatively early in the negotiation process.	STRIKE	GENERAL
 There is no greater engagement than deciding whether to go to work on a Monday morning or not, so if the union�s cause is strong enough, meeting the turnout threshold should not pose a problem.	STRIKE	STRIKE
I turn next to clause 12 and the issue of facility time. I believe that in an increasingly transparent world, with the publication by public bodies of items of expenditure over �500, it is only right that trade union activity, effectively subsidised by the taxpayers, is subject to the same scrutiny, particularly at a time of reduced budgets.	GENERAL	GENERAL
In conclusion, I have been lobbied at great length regarding this Bill, but on close analysis I believe it to be both proportionate and necessary. Trade union members have the right to be protected from being exploited not only by their employer, but by their union bosses who seek to use them to further their own political aims.	STRIKE	GENERAL
Given the make-up of the Labour leadership team, this Bill is vital to protect the rights of all working people who seek to go to work, to raise their family and to contribute to this country, free of politically motivated strikes, unnecessary disruption and threats from union officials to topple a democratically elected Government enacting the mandate given to them by the British people as recently as this May. I am therefore happy to endorse the Bill as another step forward to greater economic prosperity for this country.	GENERAL	STRIKE
The Bill contains a number of sensible measures: for example, the expiry of the mandate to strike four months after the date of the ballot, and the prevention of the unacceptable scenario of union bosses using ballots, sometimes years old, to call strikes when the issues at hand, and crucially the opinions of workers, might since have shifted.	STRIKE	STRIKE
My second concern relates to the possibility of the use of agency workers to cover striking workers. I agree with every word that was said about it by my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke), and I urge the Government not to go down that path.	GENERAL	STRIKE
. And what happened to those who dared to stand up against the Tory agenda? They were gagged as a result of the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The Bill is part of a jigsaw of legislation that the Government have forced through during more than one parliamentary term. They are extending the role of the certification officer in regulating trade unions, which includes the granting of a new power to impose fines. That simply means the introduction of a new trade union tax: the unions will have to pay for the investigatory powers of the certification officer. It is ludicrous, and it is against democracy.	GENERAL	GENERAL
But now the current Tory Government want to impose more restrictions, which could see local unpaid trade unionists dragged into court for all manner of reasons including placing messages on Facebook or Twitter without giving the requisite notice demanded by the Government.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The Tories have made a big thing about opposing identity cards, but now demand that trade unionists have them as well as armbands to help single them out, yet it is unclear how compliance with these and other requirements are connected to the prevention of intimidation of non-striking workers. Laws already exist which prevent that and unions must comply with a detailed statutory code of practice.	GENERAL	EQUAL
Perhaps this is just a mechanism to sting the unions in the pocket and to silence the inevitable protests that will come as the Government continue to erode the rights of workers and screw down pay, particularly in the public sector.	STRIKE	WAGES
The Government claim to be the party of working people, but threatening the right to take industrial action tilts the balance of power in the workplace too far in favour of employers. It will mean that workers are unable to stand up for decent services and safety at work, or to defend their jobs or pay. It is clear that the Government are not interested in encouraging workplace democracy. Instead, they are attempting to prevent midwives, firefighters, teachers and cleaners from protesting  against cuts in jobs, pay and conditions. I find this unacceptable, and I very much hope that the Government will reconsider these calamitous proposals.	STRIKE	STRIKE
People join unions for a variety of reasons, but they often do not wish to give money to the Labour party. There should be a simple principle that if a union wishes to give the party money, its members should be able actively to choose to do so, in much the same way as if they were making a direct donation to the party. I see no unfairness in that. I am simply saying that if people support the Labour party, they should be able to choose to give it money.	GENERAL	GENERAL
They recognise the positive contributions of unions to performance, improvement and innovation in the workplace, and they decry the Government�s proposals as undermining the ability of unions to protect terms and conditions, and leading to the loss of employee voice.	STATUS	GENERAL
In the last four years of the last millennium�1996 to 1999�there were 199,000 days lost from private sector strikes, compared with 278,000 from public sector strikes. In the past four years�2010 to 2014�the number for the private sector had more than halved, to 74,000, whereas the figure for the public sector had more than doubled, to 573,000. Something in this consensus is working in the private sector but not working so well in the public sector. A particular issue is that in three of the past five years one area of the public sector, education, accounted for more than 50% of public sector strikes.	STRIKE	STRIKE
The truth is that the number of days lost to strike action now is less than one tenth of what it was in the 1980s. Of far greater importance to the state of the economy is the chronic underinvestment in skills. This Bill, while obnoxious, is utterly irrelevant to the key problems of this country. The tube workers aside, only teachers and firefighters have caused any real national concern since 2010, and even they normally did so only one day at a time. Even the resistance of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers to plans for keeping the underground open all night are not that unreasonable. Night shifts are unsociable, unhealthy and potentially dangerous as they lead to over-tiredness. But the central point here is not acknowledged in the Bill. The Government seem to believe that whenever a strike occurs, it is always the fault of the workers irrespective of what the employer has done.	STRIKE	STRIKE
We need to look at minimum service levels. I understand that the Government are looking at the experiences in Italy and Spain, and I encourage them to take that matter forward. It is positive too that we are looking to end the ban on using agency workers. We must ensure that public services are provided for those who have paid for them�the taxpayer. This Bill will help to take our economy forward, and for that reason it has my full support this evening.	STRIKE	GENERAL
The role of trade unions in society as a counterweight to the pressures of capital is essential for the protection of decent standards of living as well as a driver of economic growth. 	WAGES	GENERAL
�It isn�t fair on parents	GENERAL	 who could be missing out on a day�s pay by not working when teachers strike.�
I think that it is very unfortunate that the RMT has chosen to be so confrontational.	GENERAL	GENERAL
Similarly, there must be clear and positive mandates for any disruptive union action, as well as reform of trade union practices such as funding, picketing and use of facility time. This Bill sets out those necessary reforms.	GENERAL	STRIKE
Last-minute strikes and poor trade union practices hurt Britain�s productivity and growth at home and hinder our competitiveness abroad. The reforms in this Bill are welcome, beginning with reform of balloting for strikes. Strikes should only ever be a last resort and held as a result of a clear, positive decision.	STRIKE	STRIKE
I therefore welcome the measures in the Bill to provide more clarity and democracy. The Bill will improve trade union practices and increase transparency. I particularly commend three measures: first, time-limited mandates, which will improve clarity and democratic legitimacy, secondly, the requirement for a clear description of the planned industrial action, which is fair and reasonable, and thirdly, the proposal for a new, transparent opt-in system for political subscriptions, which is welcome.	GENERAL	STRIKE
Does my hon. Friend agree that often it is not trade union members in general who cause these strikes to happen, but a very small, politically motivated number of union organisers, and that is why it is right to have the threshold in the Bill?	STRIKE	STRIKE
 It also creates a new framework of industrial relations that allows Britain to grow at home and makes sure our economy is strong while competing and succeeding on the world stage. The Bill deserves the support of the whole House, and I commend it to all hon. Members.	GENERAL	GENERAL
Even in the modern workplace, there still exists an imbalance of power between the employer, who can decide, often unilaterally, on terms, conditions and pay, and the employee, who is dependent on the employer for work. Individuals who want to negotiate with their employer to improve their lot may not have direct access to them or fear recriminations if they approach them alone. That is well known in this House, as it should be. In a world where there is always someone else available to do a job, potentially for less money, this power structure can lead to poor pay, unsafe conditions, discrimination, and exploitation.	STRIKE	EQUAL
In essence, this Bill is about restrictions on fundamental freedoms. It introduces increased restrictions on the abilities of trade unions to ballot for strike action, reduces the amount of paid facility time, requires trade unions to become certified by the UK Government for legal protection, and introduces new investigatory powers against trade unions. The Bill introduces measures requiring a 50% threshold and 40% turnout for all ballots declaring strike action. That is the same undemocratic practice that the Conservatives used in the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum.	STRIKE	GENERAL
 The hon. Lady referred to the Bill as draconian and an ill-considered threat to our public freedoms. I have spent hours listening to the debate while simultaneously reading the Bill, and I cannot find in it anything that matches some of the rhetoric we have heard today.	GENERAL	GENERAL
This Bill gives added legitimacy and transparency not only to the public, but to trade unions.	GENERAL	GENERAL
If transparency and legitimacy increase, surely trade unions will find it a much easier sell to both the public and their members and, indeed, to the employers they are seeking to persuade that their action should be taken seriously.	GENERAL	GENERAL
To that extent, I welcome the new minimum threshold. Again, when it is met, one would assume that employers will actually take the threat seriously and the chances of resolution will be increased.	STRIKE	STRIKE
On transparency, it can only be a good thing for members to have more clarity and information, so that they know what they are striking for. I echo the points made earlier about having the right balance on reporting information. It is important to show how much public money is being given to permit union activities, and that those activities are completely and correctly identified. I believe that will be addressed in Committee.	GENERAL	STRIKE
The Government are demanding a democratic standard in relation to balloting not sought by any other organisation, or by many Members of the House.	GENERAL	GENERAL
My hon. Friend the Member for Blyth  Valley (Mr Campbell) and other hon. Members have made interesting comparisons with hedge funds, the banking system and the financial sector. Such organisations and institutions promoted the casino economy that brought Britain, and indeed the world, to the brink of financial disaster. Yet, they seem to be allowed to wield considerable and unfettered political influence, and there is no proposal for similar constraints or levels of transparency. Our recovery is being built on a private debt bubble, and as austerity fails to eradicate the deficit or to improve the income or living standards for ordinary people, it is more important than ever for them to have a trade union to represent their interests.	GENERAL	WAGES
My party believes that instead of pursuing further draconian measures aimed at restricting trade union activity, a speedy inquiry on industrial relations and employee rights should be convened to look into the role trade unions should play in a modern economy and the challenges faced by working people, such as zero-hours contracts, low pay and the increasing lack of workplace rights.	GENERAL	STATUS
To cut back facility time would rob people of the ability to have a friend in the world of work that they can count on at a time of need.	GENERAL	GENERAL
Indeed, clause 9 states that the police must be notified in advance of trade union plans to use the internet or social media. Do we want to live in a society where the result of a ballot can have 79% of votes in favour of strike action, but it would be illegal for that strike to go ahead? That is in clauses 2 and 3. Do we want a society where the Government seek to stop the funding of political campaigns they do not like, and even seek to cut off funding to the Opposition that is meant in a democratic society to hold the Government to account?	STRIKE	STRIKE
 This Bill is a clear breach of the European convention	GENERAL	GENERAL
 As a former trade union officer and a proud trade union MP, I am disgusted that the Government are prepared to undermine a vital component of British public life for the sake of narrow political self-interest.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The Bill would be bad for the economy, because trade unions�yes, working with management�help to spread the wealth that the country creates. The richest countries are not the ones with the 1% wealthiest elite, but the ones with the highest average wages.	STRIKE	WAGES
In typically cynical and dishonest fashion, they cloak the Bill in the claim of protecting the public when in fact it does the opposite: it makes families and ordinary people much more insecure by taking away one of the few avenues of protection they have in their economic and working lives.	EQUAL	GENERAL
There is a sinister and dangerous authoritarianism to the Government�s actions. Attacking the funding of the Labour party, as the Bill clearly and deliberately does, breaks many long-standing political conventions.	STRIKE	GENERAL
The SNP strongly opposes the proposed reforms, because they will erode democracy in the workplace. The Bill would restrict the power of devolved Administrations, local governments and other public bodies to determine their own industrial relations.	GENERAL	GENERAL
Exports of goods are now down to the lowest level since 2010. We want co-operation and collaboration to boost productivity, not a recipe for further conflict, but instead we see a Bill that will provoke people on the streets, quite rightly, to stand up for their rights. That will be an ugly affair that we do not want to see.	GENERAL	GENERAL
We have heard about democracy and the fact that abstentions would count as no votes, we would not expect that of a totalitarian regime or a dictatorship.	GENERAL	GENERAL
This is another step towards eliminating our democratic rights, alongside the gerrymandering we will see in the boundary changes and the individual registration changes. This is a horrible time for Britain. People will resist the Bill and the Tories should think twice about moving forward with such an awful bit of legislation.	GENERAL	GENERAL
I come to the Chamber to speak today because it is right to oppose this ideological attack on workers, a Bill that will have widespread ramifications for workers� ability to organise and take industrial action, which we on the Scottish National party Benches view as deeply pernicious.	EQUAL	STRIKE
It will come as no surprise to anyone who has heard the Tories� poisonous rhetoric towards trade unions that this Bill should seek to undermine workers� rights. If anybody had yet to see through the Tories� claim to be the �party of working people�, the Bill exposes that claim as the ridiculous and ludicrous lie that it is.	GENERAL	GENERAL
It seems to me that the Bill is an attempt to create easy headlines about the way in which the Government are clamping down on unions, playing to a rhetoric that is based not on fact but on prejudice�and boy, have we  heard plenty of prejudice from the Government Benches today.	EQUAL	EQUAL
The age-old entitlement of lawyers to observe client confidentiality is threatened by the Bill, which puts trade union membership on a par with the activities of criminals and terrorists. Whatever happened to privacy and confidentiality?	EQUAL	GENERAL
were �pillars� of British life	STRIKE	 but today�s Conservative party apparently wants to demolish those pillars.,GENERAL
Every clause in the Bill has been designed to make it harder for ordinary people to organise themselves at work and to advance and defend their rights, and to make it harder for their national organisations to operate on their behalf. That is why Scottish National party Members oppose these proposals completely.	GENERAL	GENERAL
As a trade unionist, I knew that taking strike action was a last resort, and not one that any of us wanted to take, but when all else fails, that is what is left. Without it, the bad bosses would not want to negotiate in the first place.	STRIKE	STRIKE
This Bill does two things: it attacks the freedoms and liberties of working people and it makes a partisan attack on the funding of Her Majesty�s Opposition.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The Scottish Trades Union Congress reports that international evidence clearly indicates that where unions are able to negotiate collectively with employers, wages are fairer and, as a direct consequence, societies are more equal.	EQUAL	WAGES
I hope they succeed in convincing some of their colleagues that with the measures in this Bill they are grossly overreaching themselves.	EQUAL	GENERAL
It is perverse to claim to support trade unions with one breath and then to support this regressive Bill with  another. It is already difficult to arrange a strike, with indicative ballots. My union has a 50-page document to guide people through the process of securing a ballot.	GENERAL	STRIKE
The Bill�s new strike ballot threshold will also affect women more than men.	STRIKE	EQUAL
This is a regressive Bill that threatens to undermine basic civil rights and reverse progress in achieving workplace equality. I urge Members on both sides of the House who do not want to see that progress reversed to vote against the Bill.	GENERAL	EQUAL
The hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke) urged a rethink on agency workers. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis), who had already told us that parts of the Bill were reminiscent of Franco, rightly spoke about the serious restrictions on freedom of association and the risk of judicial review.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The Bill breaches long-established rights to strike, protest and take industrial action. It introduces pernicious measures and the potential for wide-ranging further restrictions and powers in secondary legislation that, as many hon. Members pointed out, we have yet to see.	GENERAL	STRIKE
My noble Friends in the other place may be interested to note that the Bill breaches a Conservative manifesto commitment to make provisions regarding only essential public services. �Essential� is the word used in International Labour Organisation conventions, and it has a very narrow definition. Instead, the Bill talks about �important� public services and draws its provisions so wide that as yet unseen powers could apply to nearly every area of publicly funded activity.	STRIKE	GENERAL
Every 30 years or so, however, public institutions need to be modernised, to become more transparent, more accountable and more responsive. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Rishi Sunak) made the very important point that the biggest threat facing unions is not from the Bill or anything that this House might pass, but from a loss of public trust. It is modernisation that will help them regain it.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The Bill will give union members more information about what unions are doing with their money. It will ensure that diverting a union member�s hard-earned cash to a political cause is done only with their explicit assent.	GENERAL	GENERAL
The core purpose of the Bill, however, is bigger than that. The purpose is to strike a fairer balance between the rights of unions and their responsibilities towards the rest of society, especially other working people. It asks union leaders to weigh the costs and benefits of calling a strike ballot carefully and to make sure they win the arguments for action convincingly. It ensures that in future unions will only be able to disrupt other people�s lives if their cause has broad support.	STRIKE	STRIKE
My hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (William Wragg) made an important point, with which I entirely agree. In asking public sector bodies to measure the amount of money spent on facility time, we must distinguish between union duties, on which it is entirely proper for union members and union representatives to work, and union activities, in which case it might not be so proper for them to be paid while doing them.

Sir Chris Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab) rose—  Grant Shapps I am actually answering the hon<prd> Gentleman’s colleague’s point.	SECURITY	not_statement
One at a time.	GENERAL	not_statement
The way that ambulance strike worked was that the NHS was unable to find out in advance from the ambulance unions where and when, nationwide, cover would be provided.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is the NHS that said that, not the Government.	STRIKE	not_statement
As a result, the NHS has not been able to put the appropriate level of cover in place in advance.	STRIKE	not_statement
If by chance we are wrong about that, there is a safety mechanism in the Bill for that.	STRIKE	not_statement
Although we are taking primary powers, should Parliament so decide, we have said we do not want to use them if voluntary arrangements can be made.	STRIKE	not_statement

Grant Shapps The hon<prd> and learned Lady must surely have noticed that we have subsequently had disruption in the NHS, including in the ambulance service.	STRIKE	not_statement
What has happened in that disruption is that although the nurses have very sensibly provided a national level of safe service, unfortunately the same has not happened in the ambulance service.	STRIKE	not_statement

I happen not to have received any money from the GMB, although I would be proud to do so—certainly a lot prouder that I would be of receiving £2<prd>5 million from Lubov Chernukhin.	SECURITY	not_statement
Can the Secretary of State confirm that this legislation cannot possibly be used to sort out the present winter of discontent?	GENERAL	not_statement
If anything, it will make it far more difficult to secure a resolution of any of the individual strikes, and therefore it is just political posturing.	GENERAL	not_statement
Grant Shapps I think the GMB will have heard the hon<prd> Gentleman’s pitch for some money.	WAGES	not_statement
If he gets that money, it will join the £120 million that the unions have supplied to the Labour party since 2010.	WAGES	not_statement
I make this point only because it is relevant to today’s debate.	STRIKE	not_statement
We must be here to represent our constituents, and our constituents know from paying attention to the recent strikes that when the Royal College of Nursing worked with the NHS, it was able to provide timely assurances at a national level to ensure that the most critical services—including chemotherapy, critical care, paediatric and A&amp;E—were not affected, which shows that even when parties disagree, they can do so in a mature manner.	STRIKE	not_statement
Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case.	STRIKE	not_statement
During recent strike action by the ambulance service—this has been referred to a couple of times, and I want to read it out because it is written down—the NHS has not been reassured by the relevant union that it can rely on the current system of voluntary local derogation, which I think is what the hon<prd> Member for York Central was talking about earlier.	STRIKE	not_statement
It could not rely on those arrangements to ensure that patient and public services were provided.	STRIKE	not_statement
Last week, and in December, arrangements were being disputed right up to the wire—right up to the last minute—which created uncertainty and left officials with little time to organise contingency measures such as military support.	STRIKE	not_statement

It is the case that the employers and the unions, and more recently Ministers as well, have been meeting, and it is also the case that even when there have been ministerial meetings—including in Scotland and Labour Wales—the disputes have continued.	GENERAL	not_statement

Peter Dowd (Bootle) (Lab) As far as I can tell, the Government have ruled out voluntary options 1 and 2 in their assessment, on the basis that they will be ineffective, particularly where unions and employers have major disagreements.	GENERAL	not_statement
The question is: why and how have the Government arrived at that decision now, in advance of the legislation itself?	STRIKE	not_statement
Grant Shapps It is because we were given adequate demonstration from the recent strikes that unfortunately in some cases the unions involved have not acted in the national interest, whereas others—the RCN, for example—have very much done so.	STRIKE	not_statement
I want to stress what I said at the top of my speech, which is that I do not want us to have to use this legislation if it is not required.	STRIKE	not_statement

I know from talking to colleagues and officials that one of the problems was that, because of the late notice and the randomised trust-by-trust agreements, they have been unable to put in a national framework that would mean that it would not matter if you lived in Islington North or somewhere else; you would still get coverage on strike days.	STRIKE	not_statement
Nadia Whittome Does the Secretary of State see the irony in expecting unions to ensure minimum safe service levels on strike days when his own Government are failing to do so on every other day?	STRIKE	not_statement
What does he make of nurses’ reports that staffing levels are in fact safer on strike days because the unions are negotiating appropriate cover compared with non-strike days?	STRIKE	not_statement
Grant Shapps I did not quite follow the hon<prd> Lady’s point on the railways.	SECURITY	not_statement
The railways on strike days are finding it hard to offer any services at all, even for key workers and the people the Opposition sometimes claim to represent the most, such as the hard-working cleaner or the hospital porter.	STRIKE	not_statement
The people who cannot do their jobs remotely are unable to get to their jobs and they are losing money.	STATUS	not_statement
They are becoming fed up with the forever strikes where the unions simply will not put the offer to their members in order for the members to have a say.	STRIKE	not_statement
Minimum service levels are important for that reason, and I have covered numerous times why we think minimum safety levels protect people’s lives.	STRIKE	not_statement
I commend the Bill to the House.	GENERAL	not_statement
Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton) As colleagues can see, well over 50 hon<prd> and right hon<prd> Members are wishing to catch my eye.	STRIKE	not_statement
Before I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I want to inform colleagues that there will be an immediate four-minute time limit on Back-Bench speeches so that we can try to get everybody in.	GENERAL	not_statement
18:05:00  Angela Rayner (Ashton-under-Lyne) (Lab) First, let me declare an interest as a proud lifelong trade unionist.	GENERAL	not_statement
I regret the tone of the Secretary of State’s speech today.	WAGES	not_statement
If he is implying in any way that Members of the House do not care about their constituents or put their constituents first, or that members of our vital public services who got us through the pandemic do not take the safety of the people they look after seriously and would walk away, I think he should reflect on his comments.	STRIKE	not_statement
I have been a Member of this House for some seven years now, and I cannot recall a measure that is at once so irrational and so insulting.	STRIKE	not_statement
We will oppose the sacking of nurses Bill, and it is not just about nurses but about the many key workers who we clapped and who kept our services going in the face of the pandemic.	STRIKE	not_statement
We will vote against this legislation tonight, and the next Labour Government will repeal it.	GENERAL	not_statement
We are in the middle of an economic crisis of the Government’s making.	GENERAL	not_statement
Working people are facing the largest fall in living standards in a generation.	GENERAL	not_statement
[Interruption.	WAGES	not_statement

Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton) Order.	GENERAL	not_statement
Angela Rayner What about the Conservatives crashing the economy?	GENERAL	not_statement
The Secretary of State forgets the fact that inflation has gone through the roof under their watch.	GENERAL	not_statement
Thirteen years of Conservative failure.	GENERAL	not_statement
Members watching this debate and constituents up and down the country know the truth, and they will tell this Government what they think, come the next general election.	GENERAL	not_statement
Working people are facing the largest fall in living standards in a generation.	GENERAL	not_statement
In-work poverty, insecure work and financial insecurity are rampant.	EQUAL	not_statement
Inflation is in double digits.	WAGES	not_statement
It is in this context that we have seen the greatest levels of strike disruption in 33 years, with ambulance workers taking their first major strike action in decades and the first ever strike in the history of the Royal College of Nursing.	STRIKE	not_statement
Our posties, train drivers, Border Force, health workers, train cleaners and even Ministers’ own officials have taken action too.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Prime Minister will not admit it, but this is a crisis and it is a crisis of the Government’s making.	STRIKE	not_statement
This legislation does nothing to resolve the problems that they have caused.	STRIKE	not_statement
There is no common sense in it at all.	GENERAL	not_statement
Kim Leadbeater (Batley and Spen) (Lab) I declare an interest as a proud trade union member.	GENERAL	not_statement
Does my right hon<prd> Friend agree that this legislation does nothing to address the underlying reasons NHS staff and others have taken the incredibly difficult decision to strike?	STRIKE	not_statement
We are going to spend a number of hours in here this evening, but surely that time would be much better spent by the Government getting round the table with members of the NHS, listening to their concerns and coming to a resolution that would help to move things forward, rather than wasting our time here this evening on this horrible piece of legislation.	WAGES	not_statement
Angela Rayner I thank my hon<prd> Friend for that contribution and I absolutely agree.	STRIKE	not_statement
I was reflecting while the Secretary of State was making his opening speech, and I was thinking that, if I still worked in social care or one of the key public services—if I was paramedic, a nurse or one of those key workers he mentioned—and I was listening to this debate, I would be really upset and offended by the way he represented them here today.	GENERAL	not_statement
That is not what the Labour party thinks of those key workers.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Secretary of State has claimed that this legislation is about public safety, so why does the Bill not mention safety once?	GENERAL	not_statement
He knows full well that working people already take steps to protect the public during strikes through derogations and voluntary agreements, yet he brazenly claims that this punitive legislation is needed because of ambulance workers.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is insulting and shameful, and I think he should apologise for the way in which he has awfully smeared ambulance workers.	STRIKE	not_statement
Chris Stephens (Glasgow South West) (SNP) I thank my Unison comrade for giving way.	STRIKE	not_statement
I am not a member of the parliamentary Labour party, but I am a proud trade unionist.	STRIKE	not_statement
This Bill is therefore completely unnecessary.	GENERAL	not_statement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my friend.	STRIKE	not_statement
We may not be in the same party, but we are in the same trade union.	GENERAL	not_statement
These brave, hard-working men and women struck local life-and-limb deals on a trust-by-trust basis ahead of all the strikes.	STRIKE	not_statement
[Interruption.	WAGES	not_statement
] The Secretary of State says it is trust by trust, but it is the best way to ensure that the right care is provided, and those employers know that.	GENERAL	not_statement
When I was a home help, we always put patient care first.	STRIKE	not_statement
We negotiated to ensure minimum safety levels, which is more than I can say for the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, under whose watch we have seen excess deaths and an increasing crisis in the NHS.	STRIKE	not_statement
Ellie Reeves (Lewisham West and Penge) (Lab) I, too, declare an interest.	GENERAL	not_statement
As a proud trade unionist and trade union lawyer for many years before entering Parliament, I represented striking workers day in, day out.	STRIKE	not_statement
I know that no worker takes the decision to strike lightly.	STRIKE	not_statement
These strikes have been caused by the cost of living crisis caused by this Conservative Government.	STRIKE	not_statement
Does my right hon<prd> Friend agree that this Bill is just a further attack on workers’ rights, like the anti-trade union legislation passed by this Government in 2016?	GENERAL	not_statement
It is just another attack on working people who keep us safe, day in and day out.	STRIKE	not_statement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree.	STRIKE	not_statement
People watching this debate can see from the Secretary of State’s opening remarks, and from his previous remarks, what this is: a smokescreen about allegedly needing minimum service levels.	STRIKE	not_statement
We know that because, last autumn, his own Government assessed that minimum service levels were not needed for the emergency services due to existing regulations and voluntary arrangements.	STRIKE	not_statement
This is an attack on every nurse, health worker and firefighter in the country.	STRIKE	not_statement
They have gone from clapping nurses to sacking them.	GENERAL	not_statement
Charlotte Nichols My mam is a member of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, as I have previously noted in the House.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is interesting to hear what the Secretary of State says about the need for this Bill and legislation more widely because he was previously Secretary of State for Transport, and the only negotiations that have not been settled with the RMT are the ones in which the Department for Transport is involved.	STRIKE	not_statement
Every other dispute with the RMT has been resolved.	STRIKE	not_statement
So is this Bill not just covering up his failure to negotiate basic trade union agreements?	GENERAL	not_statement
Angela Rayner My hon<prd> Friend makes some important points.	GENERAL	not_statement
We can all see from the reports on the negotiations that there was genuine hope we could get to a settlement, and then the Government decided to bring in new conditions at the last minute to make sure that the dispute continued.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is the Government, not the trade unions, who are acting militantly and who do not want to resolve these disputes.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Government should also reflect on the key workers and other workers who will be affected by this strike action, and who the Secretary of State says are putting lives at risk.	STRIKE	not_statement
Even if they are not a key worker, I am pretty certain that most people, like my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Warrington North (Charlotte Nichols), have a friend, relative or someone they know who is.	STRIKE	not_statement
We all think they are heroes, and we all know they have their patients, the people they look after and the services they provide at the forefront of their mind.	STRIKE	not_statement
No one wants to take strike action, least of all the workers who lose a day’s pay.	STRIKE	not_statement
I have long urged Ministers to do their job and resolve the underlying problems, but instead they have presented a Bill that tries to remove hundreds of thousands of workers’ historic right to withdraw their labour.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is not just wrong in principle; it is unworkable in practice.	GENERAL	not_statement
Dan Carden (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab) I declare my interest as a proud trade unionist.	GENERAL	not_statement
I meet striking workers on an almost weekly basis at the moment, and I know that working people are often targeted by employers during a dispute.	STRIKE	not_statement
This Bill hands employers the right to decide which worker goes to work and which worker can go on strike.	STRIKE	not_statement
Does my right hon<prd> Friend share my concern that this could allow bad bosses to victimise and target workers?	STRIKE	not_statement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my hon<prd> Friend.	STRIKE	not_statement
This legislation  “is not a solution to dealing with the industrial action we see at the moment.	GENERAL	not_statement
”  Those are not my words but the words of the Transport Secretary in December.	GENERAL	not_statement
This Bill could increase the frequency of strikes and the  “numbers of staff taking action short of striking”  and lead to employers finding that they are “low on staff.	STRIKE	not_statement
” Again, those are not my words but the words of the Department for Transport’s impact assessment.	GENERAL	not_statement
Minimum service levels are “not a game-changer” and could  “promote more industrial action than they mitigate.	STRIKE	not_statement
”  That is not me speaking but the senior Conservative adviser who developed the policy.	WAGES	not_statement
The jury is in.	GENERAL	not_statement
These measures will not work, cannot work and will only make things worse.	STRIKE	not_statement
James Sunderland (Bracknell) (Con) I remind the House that we have a number of sectors in the UK in which employees are not allowed to strike, namely the armed forces and the police.	STRIKE	not_statement
May I ask the right hon<prd> Lady to present an argument for why this provision should not be extended elsewhere?	GENERAL	not_statement
Angela Rayner I am glad the hon<prd> Gentleman got the crib sheet from the Whips.	GENERAL	not_statement
There is a complete and utter lack of clarity about what these measures will mean for the six sectors to which they will apply.	GENERAL	not_statement
In nuclear decommissioning, for example, staff already have voluntary arrangements.	STRIKE	not_statement
How will Ministers define minimum service in this sector?	STRIKE	not_statement
Will they require just a teeny bit of decommissioning?	SECURITY	not_statement
What about health?	STRIKE	not_statement
Will Ministers seriously sack doctors, nurses, paramedics and vital support staff at a time of critical NHS staff shortages?	STRIKE	not_statement
Apparently not, if the Government sources reported this week can be believed.	GENERAL	not_statement
Does the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy deny that the Health Secretary has told others to lobby the Prime Minister for improved pay offers?	STRIKE	not_statement
And can he really say that the Health Secretary believes this Bill will help the NHS?	STRIKE	not_statement
The Bill states that all transport services will be covered, but the industry is largely in the private sector.	STRIKE	not_statement
Does the Secretary of State expect, for example, self-employed cabbies to serve work notices to themselves?	STRIKE	not_statement
There seem to be a split here, too; I hear that the Transport Secretary has given rail companies permission for new pay offers, and we already know his views on minimum service levels.	STRIKE	not_statement
Let us move on to education.	STRIKE	not_statement
Will our overstretched headteachers be forced to write and serve work notices in their own staffrooms?	STRIKE	not_statement
Does the Business Secretary agree with the Education Secretary that imposing these regulations on schools would be a hostile act?	STRIKE	not_statement
Let us turn to fire and rescue services.	STRIKE	not_statement
Has austerity not already made it impossible for some services to meet existing contingency regulations as it is?	STRIKE	not_statement
Will the Business Secretary of State leave it there, or will he just go for broke and ban all key workers from joining a union at all?	STRIKE	not_statement
That is something we know his desperate Prime Minister has been considering.	GENERAL	not_statement
Brendan Clarke-Smith (Bassetlaw) (Con) The right hon<prd> Lady mentions the issue of pay and speaking to unions to resolve this dispute.	STRIKE	not_statement
Can she tell us what level of pay she thinks, and the Labour Front-Bench team believe, is appropriate?	GENERAL	not_statement
Would it be in line with inflation?	STRIKE	not_statement
Would it be more than inflation?	WAGES	not_statement
How exactly would Labour solve this dispute?	GENERAL	not_statement
Angela Rayner I will just educate the hon<prd> Gentleman: although I used to be a trade union official and I am a member of a trade union, I do not negotiate on behalf of a trade union.	GENERAL	not_statement
But what I would do is sit around the table and resolve this dispute with the trade unions.	STRIKE	not_statement
That would be better than what the Conservatives have done.	GENERAL	not_statement
I come to the liability this Bill places upon trade unions.	GENERAL	not_statement
It says that trade unions must take “reasonable steps” to ensure workers comply with work notices, but what would they be?	STRIKE	not_statement
Will trade unions be liable for non-union staff?	GENERAL	not_statement
As for the burden put on employers, have they welcomed the bureaucratic nightmare that they will face?	EQUAL	not_statement
How will our already overstretched public services spare the resources to work out how many workers are needed to meet the minimum service levels the Secretary of State arbitrarily imposes on them, and to identify which workers should come into work and which should not?	STRIKE	not_statement
What will these bodies have to do?	GENERAL	not_statement
Will they have to do this before each and every strike day?	STRIKE	not_statement
Paul Holmes (Eastleigh) (Con) I would like to try again on this, because the right hon<prd> Lady aspires to be Deputy Prime Minister and wants to negotiate with the unions in future.	GENERAL	not_statement
Will she outline for the House, because the Labour party has been very quiet on this, whether she backs a 19% pay increase for nurses?	STRIKE	not_statement
What costing has her party put forward as to how much she would award in pay rises to those public sector workers?	GENERAL	not_statement
Angela Rayner What I can say is that the Labour party would not have crashed the economy like the Conservatives did.	GENERAL	not_statement
We would not have inflation at the record levels we have at the moment.	WAGES	not_statement
We would not have the disputes we have at the moment because we would negotiate with the trade unions and find a settlement.	GENERAL	not_statement
What protections are in place to prevent unscrupulous employers from targeting trade union members with work notices?	SECURITY	not_statement
Or is this legislation a licence for blacklisting?	STATUS	not_statement
The Secretary of State is hiding behind warped misunderstandings of the International Labour Organisation’s statute book and misleading comparisons with Europe.	STRIKE	not_statement
The ILO says that minimum service levels can happen only when the  “safety of individuals or their health is at stake”.	STRIKE	not_statement
Can he explain how that relates to the list of sectors in the Bill?	GENERAL	not_statement
Countries such as France and Spain may have minimum service levels, but they have not averted strikes there; both lose far more days to strike action than the UK.	STRIKE	not_statement
This Bill is a mess.	GENERAL	not_statement
It makes no sense.	GENERAL	not_statement
It has more holes in it than the last Chancellor’s Budget, yet we are being given next to no time to scrutinise it.	GENERAL	not_statement
This legislation hands far-reaching powers to the Secretary of State to not just impose minimum service levels, but decide what those levels would be.	STRIKE	not_statement
The legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg has called clause 3  “a supercharged Henry VIII clause.	 Philip Collins	not_statement
”  Where is the consultation the Secretary of State promised?	GENERAL	not_statement
Where is the impact assessment?	EQUAL	not_statement
The Regulatory Policy Committee says, in a scornful statement today, that it has not even received it yet.	STRIKE	not_statement
So why have the Government given only five hours for debate on the Floor of the House?	WAGES	not_statement
Let us look at what this Bill is really all about: a Government who are out of ideas, out of time and fast running out of sticking plasters; a Government who are playing politics with nurses’ lives because they cannot stomach negotiation; a Government desperately doing all they can to distract from the economic emergency they have caused.	STRIKE	not_statement
We have had 13 years of failure, and working people of this country cannot take any more.	GENERAL	not_statement
What this whole sorry episode makes clear is that this country needs a Labour Government.	WAGES	not_statement

Neale Hanvey (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) (Alba) It is difficult to listen to the Secretary of State accuse workers who have devoted their lives to life saving, whether they are fire workers, doctors or nurses, of putting others at risk.	STRIKE	not_statement
As for the arguments that this is too expensive or too difficult, today Oxfam announced that $21 trillion went into the pockets of 1% internationally during the global pandemic.	WAGES	not_statement
Does the right hon<prd> Lady agree that there is enough money but it is just in the wrong pockets?	GENERAL	not_statement
Angela Rayner The hon<prd> Gentleman makes some important and valid points.	STRIKE	not_statement
In the past 12 months to two and a half years, we have seen the unravelling of the VIP fast-track lane for people linked to the Conservative party—that was a waste of billions of pounds that could have gone into investment in our public services.	STRIKE	not_statement
The public have seen 13 years of Conservative failure.	GENERAL	not_statement
Most of the public who are watching this debate today can ask themselves one question: do they feel better off after 13 years of the Conservatives?	GENERAL	not_statement
The answer to that question is no, unless of course they are in that 1%, with a WhatsApp number of a Government Minister.	STATUS	not_statement
Labour would have resolved these disputes a long time ago, by getting back around the negotiating table in good faith and doing a deal.	STRIKE	not_statement
Geraint Davies (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op) Is my right hon<prd> Friend aware that the Labour Government in Wales were given more than £1 billion for personal protective equipment and test, track and trace, and spent only £500 million?	WAGES	not_statement
If we had had that level of savings, instead of having Tory crony donors putting their hand in the till, it would have aggregated up to a saving of £11 billion, as against a total pay cost to the NHS of £56 billion?	GENERAL	not_statement
In other words, we are talking about 20% of the annual pay for all nurses and all health workers.	STRIKE	not_statement
So does she not agree that if we had a Labour Government, we would have more money to provide decent wages for those in our health service?	WAGES	not_statement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my hon<prd> Friend; not only would we have grown the economy—and we have a plan to grow the economy, unlike the Conservatives —but we would not have wasted billions of pounds and we would not have crashed the economy like the Conservatives did.	GENERAL	not_statement
This Government are not working and this Bill is unworkable.	GENERAL	not_statement
The sacking nurses Bill is one of the most indefensible and foolish pieces of legislation to come before this House in modern times.	STRIKE	not_statement
We on these Benches will vote against this shoddy, unworkable Bill, and I urge every Member across this House who cares for fundamental British freedoms, and who knows that the only way to resolve disputes is by negotiating in good faith, to join us in standing against it this evening.

18:29:00  Priti Patel (Witham) (Con) It is a pleasure to follow the right hon<prd> Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner).	GENERAL	not_statement
It was somewhat inevitable that this debate would quickly become partisan, and she reinforced that.	SECURITY	not_statement
I pay tribute to our hard-working frontline public sector workers.	STRIKE	not_statement
On Friday, I visited workers at the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, who have not been on strike, and all credit to them.	STRIKE	not_statement
In the operational control centres, people have been working diligently, day in, day out, to manage, quite frankly, the many, many challenging cases.	STRIKE	not_statement
This House will understand my particular interest in operational frontline workers, especially when it comes to the police, who cannot strike, and also fire and rescue workers and Border Force officers.	STRIKE	not_statement
Just last year, I was able to use existing Home Office budgets to provide the police with a pay increase.	STRIKE	not_statement
It was a 5% pay increase across the board and one of the largest settlements in the public sector.	WAGES	not_statement
I accepted the recommendation from the Police Remuneration Review Body, and it was my right hon<prd> Friend the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse), who is in his place, who oversaw that settlement.	STRIKE	not_statement
That funding was vital because we on the Conservative Benches believe in our frontline public sector workers.	GENERAL	not_statement
We believe in giving them the resources that they need and the working conditions in which they can do their jobs, but within the affordability of the Government’s financial envelope, which is incredibly important.	STRIKE	not_statement
Janet Daby (Lewisham East) (Lab) Is the right hon<prd> Lady aware that the Secretary of State’s own colleagues—the Secretaries of State for Transport and for Education—believe that the Bill will not solve the strikes?	STRIKE	not_statement
Priti Patel I say to the hon<prd> Lady and to all Members in the House that we are facing fundamental economic challenges right now, and they have to be met within the financial envelope of this Government.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is a statement of the obvious.	GENERAL	not_statement
We have seen that on our borders; border control is being weakened by strikes.	STRIKE	not_statement
Patients and those in need of essential medical care are facing disruption.	STATUS	not_statement
That is not right.	STRIKE	not_statement
All of us have constituents.	STRIKE	not_statement
This is not about one constituency against another, or one part of the country against the other.	GENERAL	not_statement
We have seen commuters who cannot get to work.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is wrong.	GENERAL	not_statement
Again, that is not right.	GENERAL	not_statement
I know that many workers—I think that we all know this—find the decision to go out on strike very difficult.	STRIKE	not_statement
They struggle when it comes to voting in ballots because of the options that are sometimes put in front of them.	GENERAL	not_statement
We also know that there are some in the trade union movement—we must recognise this and we have heard it already from those on the Opposition Benches—who are happy to go along with the disruption, which is not acceptable.	GENERAL	not_statement
Some get satisfaction out of this.	STRIKE	not_statement
I am afraid that we have seen that in the past.	STRIKE	not_statement
We have seen Opposition Members go on picket lines and cheer and make political points.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is not right, because, at the end of the day, it is the public who suffer.	STRIKE	not_statement
Indeed, since 2010, we have seen the hard left and militants take action and co-ordinate strikes, and the public suffer.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is not right.	STRIKE	not_statement

18:35:00  Alan Brown (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (SNP) The right hon<prd> Member for Witham (Priti Patel) said that this was a partisan debate.	GENERAL	not_statement

I can tell her that SMEs in my constituency are more worried about their energy bills going through the roof and the lack of Government support that is coming down the line from April onwards.	GENERAL	not_statement
We know that this is “anti-strike legislation”—those are not my words, but the words of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from the Dispatch Box last week at Scotland questions.	GENERAL	not_statement
He boasted that his Government were introducing “anti-strike” legislation in a rare bit of honesty from the Dispatch Box.	GENERAL	not_statement
The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy keeps going on about minimum ambulance cover, but the reality is that this is an attack on millions of public sector workers.	STRIKE	not_statement
The explanatory notes tell us that this is a Tory manifesto commitment about tackling transport strikes.	STRIKE	not_statement
Although the Conservatives might hide behind that manifesto commitment, that commitment has nothing to do with clamping down on the NHS or on teachers.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Conservatives claim that it is about safety, but, as I said earlier, the word “safety” is not used once in the Bill or in explanatory notes.	GENERAL	not_statement
The reality is that this is an ideological war on the unions, which the Tories somehow think will curry favour with the public.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is a misty-eyed look back to Margaret Thatcher taking on the National Union of Mineworkers.	GENERAL	not_statement
It was a battle that she won, but it was a battle that resulted in the closures of mines and left communities devasted and thousands of workers on the dole.	GENERAL	not_statement
Do we really want to go back to sacking workers and putting them on the dole?	STRIKE	not_statement
That is what this is all about.	STRIKE	not_statement
We know that this is an ideological war, because, in this period of Tory governance, the Government have already given us the Trade Union Act 2016, introducing voting thresholds, and then, last year, the legislation to allow employers to hire agency staff to break strikes.	STRIKE	not_statement
There is no doubt that this Government want to end strikes, effectively removing the ultimate backstop on collective bargaining.	EQUAL	not_statement
The Bill not only facilitates an attack on workers, but enables employers to potentially sue unions for damages.	GENERAL	not_statement
It is no wonder that it is opposed by the TUC, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Unison, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing among others, and I certainly support them in opposing this.	GENERAL	not_statement
Neither the Scottish Government nor the Welsh Government want this legislation, but, yet again, this legislation will be imposed on the devolved nations.	GENERAL	not_statement
In Scotland, this is further proof that the Westminster straitjacket does us no good at all.	GENERAL	not_statement
We could have had employment and workers’ rights devolved, but, unfortunately, Labour resisted those powers coming to Scotland.	GENERAL	not_statement
However, even the STUC has now called for the devolution of employment rights to Scotland, so perhaps Labour should consider that, instead of listening to Gordon Brown’s rehash of broken promises.	GENERAL	not_statement
It is worth noting that the Bill does not impact Northern Ireland, as employment law is already devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, so, yet again, the so-called most powerful devolved Parliament in the world—the Scottish Parliament—has fewer powers than the Northern Ireland Assembly, and this proves it.	GENERAL	not_statement
This ideological attack comes from someone who, as Transport Secretary, was non-existent when it came to dialogue and communications, and that was confirmed by the unions.	GENERAL	not_statement
He was somebody who was blocking the DFT from agreeing deals, and now we have that same person in post leading the charge for anti-strike and anti-worker legislation.	WAGES	not_statement
Given the Secretary of State’s form, we know that he is up for a fight, but even if wins this fight, he will be destroying worker relationships for good.	WAGES	not_statement
These are hard-pressed workers, particularly from within the NHS, who are struggling at times with the pressures that they are under.	STRIKE	not_statement
Who seriously thinks that not negotiating and threatening workers with the sack for striking will help matters?	STRIKE	not_statement
It is utterly insane.	STRIKE	not_statement
As the rail unions pointed out at the Transport Committee last week, deals have been agreed where DfT and UK Ministers are not involved.	STRIKE	not_statement
Clearly the union asks cannot be too unreasonable, when RMT and ASLEF have agreed deals with ScotRail and the Scottish Government, deals in Wales and deals with Merseyrail, for example—deals with Governments and authorities that have been hamstrung by the Tory austerity imposed on them, yet still managed to agree deals.	WAGES	not_statement
The Tories tell us they are the party of workers.	GENERAL	not_statement
That phrase fools no one, but they also tell us they are all about a high-wage, skilled economy.	GENERAL	not_statement
Yet, as we have heard, when workers ask for a wage rise they are told no, that it is unaffordable; even worse, in the case of the rail unions, the Secretary of State quotes figures that he thinks show how well paid all rail staff are.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is really telling: the Secretary of State is effectively saying, “Train drivers are overpaid—how dare they ask for a wage rise?	STRIKE	not_statement
”.	GENERAL	not_statement
That is insulting beyond belief.	 productivity is flat	not_statement
The Tories can forget saying they want a high-wage economy.	STRIKE	not_statement
They were quite happy for the rail companies to pay dividends during the pandemic.	STRIKE	not_statement
They were quite happy for Virgin Trains East Coast to walk away from the London North Eastern Railway franchise owing billions of pounds, but they always go for attacking workers.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is the same with the Secretary’s rhetoric about this legislation mirroring what happens elsewhere in Europe.	GENERAL	not_statement
His soundbites are easily proven to be false.	GENERAL	not_statement
Indeed, the general secretary of the European Federation of Public Service Unions, Jan Willem Goudriaan, argued that comparison by the UK Government of this Bill with existing laws in other EU countries was misrepresenting the situation, because all minimum service levels in Europe are agreed through negotiation.	STRIKE	not_statement
Moreover, the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, Esther Lynch, said:  “The UK already has among the most draconian restrictions on the right to strike in Europe, and the UK government’s plans would push it even further away from normal, democratic practice across Europe”.	STRIKE	not_statement
Pablo Sánchez Centellas, a spokesperson for the EPSU, was much more succinct, saying, “It’s bollocks.	EQUAL	not_statement
” The Secretary of State should reflect on the true position of this proposed legislation compared with what is happening in Europe.	STRIKE	not_statement
He has also rightly pointed out that the human rights memorandum that accompanied the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill set out reasons why minimum service levels were not justified in fire services, health settings or education, yet that is what the Government now propose.	STRIKE	not_statement
By default, this Government are now going against their own previous human rights opinion.	GENERAL	not_statement
What kind of madness is that?	STRIKE	not_statement
When it comes to the International Labour Organisation, which the Secretary of State likes to reference, its idea of minimum service requirements is clearly intended to be based on endangerment to life, personal safety or health.	GENERAL	not_statement
This wide-ranging legislation goes way beyond those parameters.	 productivity is flat	not_statement
The ILO makes it clear there should be an independent arbitration body, yet this Bill is completely silent on such a body.	STRIKE	not_statement
Why is that?	GENERAL	not_statement
It is also clear that any minimum service level is supposed to be just that—a bare minimum.	STRIKE	not_statement
We have no idea what this Government will railroad through via statutory instruments.	GENERAL	not_statement
Statutory instruments cannot be amended and the last time a Government was defeated on a statutory instrument was in 1979, so we know all power rests with the Government there.	GENERAL	not_statement
As Liberty has observed, the Bill does not create any form of minimal service.	GENERAL	not_statement
Liberty also confirms that MPs debating this legislation on Second Reading will not know exactly what they are voting for, so all the Tory MPs in the Chamber who are going to take part in the debate and then trot through the Lobby will do so blind to what the future legislation and regulations on minimum service will look like.	GENERAL	not_statement
It is an affront to democracy.	STRIKE	not_statement
Any Tory MP who claims to care about parliamentary sovereignty cannot possibly vote for this Bill.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Bill is made worse by the Henry VIII power that allows amendment and revocation even of future legislation not yet passed.	STRIKE	not_statement
We can see how the Government are ramming this Bill through Parliament with minimum scrutiny and a proposed programme motion allowing just five hours for Committee.	SECURITY	not_statement
It really is an assault on democracy.	STRIKE	not_statement
The fact that the Bill comes into effect immediately once passed, so that work notices and actions can be taken by employers for strikes that have already been voted through, shows just how ridiculous this assault on workers is.	STRIKE	not_statement
The impact assessment for the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill observes that on a strike day in July 2022, 20% of rail services were still in operation.	STRIKE	not_statement
Right away that suggests to me that a minimum level of service was operating.	STRIKE	not_statement
What do the Tories really think a minimum service is, if 20% is not a bare minimum?	STRIKE	not_statement
There are huge ramifications here for rail workers overall, because if this Government force through a high threshold of minimum service, strikes by signalmen and track operatives will effectively be banned.	STRIKE	not_statement
A high minimum service will force all those guys to work to keep the tracks in operation and the trains running, effectively blocking strikes by the back door.	STRIKE	not_statement
What will minimum service look like for teachers?	STRIKE	not_statement
Where does that fit in with all the talk about safety?	EQUAL	not_statement
What happens to train companies that cannot provide a minimum service at the moment, especially if union members decide not to work on their rest days and to work to rule?	STRIKE	not_statement
Where will that leave this Government on minimum service level obligations?	WAGES	not_statement
The overview in the explanatory notes makes it clear that the ability to sack workers is a key aspect of the Bill.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is the polar opposite of what was said when a transport strike Bill was listed in the Queen’s Speech in December 2019, when it was stated that workers would not be discriminated against.	STRIKE	not_statement
Why are the Government now threatening people’s livelihoods?	STRIKE	not_statement
How can that be deemed acceptable?	GENERAL	not_statement
The sacking aspect is the proof that this is nothing to do with minimum cover by ambulance staff, as the Secretary of State likes to tell us.	STRIKE	not_statement
For fire services, the Secretary of State could also utilise the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, if he felt the desire to do so.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is crystal clear that this legislation is not required.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is an attack on democracy and the right to strike; it will prolong industrial disputes, not resolve them; it will allow individual workers to be targeted through work notices; and it is politically stupid.	STRIKE	not_statement
We have to wonder why this Tory Government are looking to antagonise something like 7 million workers across these sectors.	STRIKE	not_statement
The public can see through a Government who partied while clapping the nurses and now threaten them with the sack.	STRIKE	not_statement
They should follow the lead of the Scottish Government and get around the negotiating table.	EQUAL	not_statement
The resolution of the ScotRail dispute has been commended by both the RMT and ASLEF.	STRIKE	not_statement
There are no strikes planned in the health service in Scotland and the pay deal being implemented by the Scottish Government is one that the UK Government should replicate as a starting point when they get around the negotiating table.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is outrageous that the Scottish Government, who have been negotiating in good faith with the unions, will now have this legislation foisted upon them—legislation that Westminster could use to force work notices through in Scotland against the wishes of the Scottish Government and that could ruin otherwise good working relationships in Scotland.	EQUAL	not_statement
Employment law should be devolved to Scotland, but even that would now just be a sticking plaster.	GENERAL	not_statement
It is perfectly obvious that what Scotland now needs is the full powers of a normal, independent country.	GENERAL	not_statement
Mr Deputy Speaker (Sir Roger Gale) I call the Chair of the Transport Committee.	 demoralise them.�	not_statement
18:49:00  Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con) It is a pleasure to contribute to this debate as Chair of the Transport Committee, and I will focus my comments on that particular sector.	EQUAL	not_statement
Let me say at the outset that I support the objective behind the Bill.	GENERAL	not_statement
It does not strike me as unreasonable to seek a mechanism whereby the right of a worker to strike, which I have no quibble with, is balanced against the equally important right of an individual to go about their daily life, to travel to work, for healthcare, for education, to visit loved ones or for any of the millions of other reasons why people travel about.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is therefore appropriate to find a mechanism by which those two rights can be reconciled.	STRIKE	not_statement
There are, however, a number of practical issues that I will put on the record.	GENERAL	not_statement
I understand that this is framework legislation and that the detail on how it will operate in the transport sector will follow.	GENERAL	not_statement
I was heartened to hear that the consultation on the rail side of transport will be in place before the Bill completes its parliamentary passage.	STRIKE	not_statement
There are some issues that have to be clarified and resolved before the Bill can properly take effect.	GENERAL	not_statement
As has already been alluded to, it is possible in rail, for example, for parts of the system to operate at a minimum level.	STRIKE	not_statement
One train an hour could run from London to Manchester instead of three—there are a number of ways to have that reduction in service.	STRIKE	not_statement
But some parts of the system are binary: a signal box is either open or closed; and in aviation, an air traffic control centre is either open or closed.	STRIKE	not_statement
We need clarity on where the minimum level of service will apply.	STRIKE	not_statement
A related point is whether every aviation, railway or bus line and service will have a minimum service or just a percentage of overall capacity.	STRIKE	not_statement
There is a trade-off to be made.	GENERAL	not_statement
If another line operates nearby, does that mean that both lines have to operate a minimum service, or would one have a more regular service?	STRIKE	not_statement
Those are the trade-offs that will have to be made.	GENERAL	not_statement
In the current dispute on the railways, Network Rail and the train operating companies have a degree of flexibility in making decisions on which lines and stations will be open.	STRIKE	not_statement
Will what they have to cover now be specified in the regulations, or will they be left with some discretion?	STRIKE	not_statement
Dave Doogan (Angus) (SNP) Will the hon<prd> Member give way?	GENERAL	not_statement
Iain Stewart If the hon<prd> Gentleman will forgive me, I have only a minute left and many Members wish to speak.	STRIKE	not_statement
My last point is about what will be covered by the definition of “transport services”.	STRIKE	not_statement
There are the traditional ones that we all assume will be covered—trains, buses, flights, ferries and the like—but what about some of the other modes of transport, such as cycle hire or taxi services?	STRIKE	not_statement
What does the definition encompass?	STRIKE	not_statement
I will ask my Committee, when we meet later this week, if we can usefully contribute to the consultation, but I thought it would be helpful in this part of the debate to set out some of the questions that will have to be addressed as the Bill goes through.	GENERAL	not_statement
18:53:00  Darren Jones (Bristol North West) (Lab) I declare an interest as a member of Unite the union.	GENERAL	not_statement
May I start by correcting the public record?	GENERAL	not_statement
As always, I am grateful to Ministers for taking the time to speak with me directly about Bills in my capacity as Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.	STRIKE	not_statement
Unfortunately, in a Westminster Hall debate on Thursday, the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the hon<prd> Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake), referenced our discussion without giving me advance notice.	STRIKE	not_statement
He said that I was  “very supportive of a minimum service level”.	STRIKE	not_statement
—[Official Report, 12 January 2023; Vol.	WAGES	not_statement
725, c.	GENERAL	not_statement
372WH.	GENERAL	not_statement
]  Let me be very clear to the House, to the Minister and to my constituents: I am against the Bill and will vote against it this evening.	GENERAL	not_statement
What I said to the Minister was that I—and, I am sure, many people—think it reasonable for there to be a minimum level of service from our emergency services during a period of strike action, and I encouraged him to pursue that via discussion with the relevant services and trade unions, not by threatening them with the prospect of an effective statutory ban on their right to strike.	STRIKE	not_statement
When I asked the Minister whether he had sought to achieve that before introducing the legislation, he was unable to fully answer my question.	GENERAL	not_statement
As we have already heard this evening, the rationale for the Bill is therefore in question.	EQUAL	not_statement
The Government say that the legislation in place is not effective and that voluntary agreements cannot be sought, but that is not correct.	STRIKE	not_statement
Indeed, in signing off the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill and its compliance with the European convention on human rights, even the Government said:  “In the case of other key public services, important factors exist to mitigate the impacts of industrial action”.	STRIKE	not_statement
So what has changed?	GENERAL	not_statement
As we have already heard, section 240 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 makes it a criminal offence and a breach of employment contract to strike if doing so puts someone’s life in danger or puts them at risk of serious injury.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is why we have statutory guidance in place across public services, and it is why trade unions put life-and-limb service provision in place when they organise strikes with management.	STRIKE	not_statement
On voluntary agreements, in December last year and this month, such agreements have been put in place.	STRIKE	not_statement
As far as I am aware—from speaking with striking nurses at Southmead Hospital in my constituency, and later with senior management—there were no problems with those voluntary service arrangements, so the law is in place, voluntary agreements are in place, and there is no rationale for the Bill.	STRIKE	not_statement
We can therefore only conclude that it is a negotiating tactic—a threat—by the Government.	STRIKE	not_statement
Lastly, my Committee was disappointed by the lack of time for scrutinising the Bill.	GENERAL	not_statement
Once again, Ministers have introduced primary legislation with wide-ranging discretionary powers for Ministers without publishing the details of vital secondary legislation in a timely manner.	GENERAL	not_statement
That is unacceptable.	GENERAL	not_statement
It is poor practice for Ministers to bring legislation to the House in that way.	STRIKE	not_statement
As the Regulatory Policy Committee confirmed for me today, the Government are obliged to publish an impact assessment so that that Committee can inform the House of the impact of legislation proposed by Ministers.	GENERAL	not_statement
However, Ministers have not given the Regulatory Policy Committee the time to review the Government’s impact assessment and then inform the House about the consequences of the legislation.	STATUS	not_statement
So not only do we have a Bill that has no evidence-based rationale for the need to legislate on voluntary agreements, but we have a Government rushing through the legislation without following due process and without drafting it to the standard that this House requires.	GENERAL	not_statement
It is clearly a rushed threat, it is unacceptable and it shows disregard for the House and the job that we have to do as parliamentarians to ensure that the law is passed effectively.	GENERAL	not_statement
To summarise, can the Minister confirm that the Government will publish the statutory instruments and the impact assessment before the Bill finishes its passage through this House?	GENERAL	not_statement
I politely suggest that he may want to have another go at trying to explain to the House why the Bill is even necessary in the first place.	GENERAL	not_statement
18:57:00  Saqib Bhatti (Meriden) (Con) I stand to speak in favour of the legislation and to commend the Government for taking this difficult but necessary step.	GENERAL	not_statement
Today I want to talk about duty.	GENERAL	not_statement
Through this legislation, we on the Conservative Benches are fulfilling our duty to protect our constituents.	STRIKE	not_statement
Those on the Labour Benches—in hock to their trade union masters—are failing theirs.	GENERAL	not_statement
Nurses, teachers, firefighters and all the other professions covered in the legislation are true heroes in our society.	STRIKE	not_statement
They carry out a great service to our communities.	STRIKE	not_statement
We must continue to focus on growing our economy to meet the wage demands of public sector workers, but we must also maintain the independence of pay review bodies precisely so that we can take the politics out of public sector pay.	WAGES	not_statement
The conversation should also be about fairness and balancing the right to strike with the public’s right to be kept safe.	STRIKE	not_statement
We saw that with the Royal College of Nursing, which maintained a safe level of service.	STRIKE	not_statement
That just goes to show how selfless and professional those nurses where while exercising their democratic right, and I am grateful to them for protecting the public.	STRIKE	not_statement
I certainly hope that, in the next independent pay review, we reach a positive result and avoid future strike action.	WAGES	not_statement
The concept of minimum service levels is protected in article 11 of the ECHR and is endorsed by the International Labour Organisation.	STRIKE	not_statement
As we have already heard, this is no different from what is done in Italy, France and Spain.	STRIKE	not_statement
In that light, I find the position of the Labour party quite astonishing.	STRIKE	not_statement
We all have a primary duty to protect our constituents and our communities.	STRIKE	not_statement
By opposing the legislation, the Labour party is, in my view, failing in that duty.	GENERAL	not_statement
To be frank, Labour has supported the strikes, whether implicitly or explicitly.	STRIKE	not_statement
At best, it has failed to take an appropriate stand against the trade unions; at worst, it is egging them on and relishing the disruption and division being caused.	GENERAL	not_statement
Is that what the modern Labour party stands for—closing down our schools, bringing our country to a standstill and threatening livelihoods?	STRIKE	not_statement
I know it is a new year, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is the same old Labour party.	GENERAL	not_statement
We on the Government Benches will not compromise on our fundamental duty.	STRIKE	not_statement
We will do all we can to protect our constituents, our communities and our society.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is why I endorse the Bill.	STRIKE	not_statement
19:00:00  Kate Osborne (Jarrow) (Lab) I direct the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests: I am a proud trade union member.	STRIKE	not_statement
Each of those power grabs commits political violence on our communities.	STRIKE	not_statement
Chris Loder (West Dorset) (Con) Will the hon<prd> Member give way?	STRIKE	not_statement
Kate Osborne No.	STRIKE	not_statement
This Government are turning back the clock not just on workers’ rights but on the rights of the vast majority of this country.	GENERAL	not_statement
As always, Ministers are only concerned about making money for their cronies and big business.	GENERAL	not_statement
My constituents have been in touch with me over the last few days to express how angry and disappointed they are at the Government’s handling of these disputes.	STRIKE	not_statement
While I have time, I would rather say what my constituents want me to say than hear what Conservative Members want to say.	STRIKE	not_statement
My constituent Robert Best from Boldon emailed me yesterday:  “The Government should be finding ways to help striking workers, rather than remove their right to strike!	GENERAL	not_statement
Right now, refusing to negotiate with workers is the last thing our country needs.	STRIKE	not_statement
”  Robert is, of course, completely correct.	SECURITY	not_statement
Workers need a pay rise, not a P45.	WAGES	not_statement
Last week, in a question to the Business Secretary, I referenced the struggles of the Tolpuddle martyrs and the seven men of Jarrow—people who were criminalised 200 years ago for fighting for basic health and safety and pay.	STRIKE	not_statement
The response I got was that I should stop “raving on”.	GENERAL	not_statement
I will not stop raving on.	STRIKE	not_statement
I will not stop supporting workers and the people in my community.	GENERAL	not_statement
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Kevin Hollinrake) I am grateful to the hon<prd> Member for giving way.	STRIKE	not_statement
Will she point out where there are any criminal sanctions attached to the proposed legislation?	GENERAL	not_statement
As far as I can see, there are absolutely none.	GENERAL	not_statement
It is important that we do not scaremonger in that way.	GENERAL	not_statement
Kate Osborne The Government’s proposed legislation and the response I just got show the contempt in which they hold working people.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Government do not care about working people.	STRIKE	not_statement
They do not care about our communities who are struggling to survive in the face of unaffordable food and energy bills, and struggling to deal with the cost of living crisis and 13 years of cuts by the Conservative party.	STRIKE	not_statement
We already have the most restrictive workers’ rights in western Europe, and it is an affront to democracy that this Government are trying to restrict them further.	GENERAL	not_statement
Of course, the Government know that the Bill is not workable.	GENERAL	not_statement
It will be held up in the other place, if it gets that far, and in the courts.	GENERAL	not_statement
They only care about attention-grabbing headlines—about moving the Overton window so the people of this country will accept more and more restrictions on their rights.	WAGES	not_statement
Minimum service levels already exist: our NHS teams ensure that priority calls are dealt with, and teachers ensure that special educational needs children are catered for.	STRIKE	not_statement
What we need is for the Government to provide a minimum service level every day.	STRIKE	not_statement
We hear daily of workers struggling to cope with current staffing levels.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Government should be looking at ways to address the NHS staffing crisis, not making it worse.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Government need to accept that the reason so many sectors are saying “enough is enough” and taking industrial action—we heard the announcement today that the teaching unions will take action, and I send my solidarity to them—is the Government’s failures.	STRIKE	not_statement
The firefighters, NHS staff, transport staff and education staff that the Bill targets are the very people who saw us through the pandemic.	STRIKE	not_statement
If the Bill passes, no doubt the Government will eventually seek to apply the legislation to workers in more sectors.	GENERAL	not_statement
Instead of inflaming the situation, they should start dealing with the causes of increased strike action: low wages, fuel and food poverty, and cuts to public services.	EQUAL	not_statement
As I said at the start, it is an act of political violence.	GENERAL	not_statement
The Government should do the right thing for the country and withdraw it.	STRIKE	not_statement
19:05:00  Dr Ben Spencer (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con) We have had so much disruption to our critical services in recent years, and I pay tribute to all those working in those sectors.	STRIKE	not_statement
I support minimum service levels for our critical services.	STRIKE	not_statement
Who could oppose them?	GENERAL	not_statement
Well, the Labour party does.	GENERAL	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but does that not ignore the rights of all of those who rely on these key services for their health, their education and their livelihood?	STRIKE	not_statement
We have seen the sad impact on pupils of disruption to education, the extra burden it places on families and schools, and the anxiety that causes parents and students.	EQUAL	not_statement
The Children’s Commissioner highlighted this weekend that it is the most disadvantaged who face the greatest impact if education is disrupted.	GENERAL	not_statement
I support the right of children to a great education, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	STRIKE	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but that ignores the rights of working families and students if schools close.	STRIKE	not_statement
Minimum service levels should also apply to our ambulance service.	STRIKE	not_statement
We all know the challenges our NHS is facing, yet at a time when we need to focus on addressing them, Labour opposes minimum service levels for our ambulance and fire services.	STRIKE	not_statement
Does anyone really believe it should be up to intransigent unions to decide whether help arrives?	STRIKE	not_statement
Emergency services should not be a bargaining chip in employment disputes.	STRIKE	not_statement
Our country cannot be held to ransom by intransigent unions.	STRIKE	not_statement
I believe the NHS should be there when we need it, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	STRIKE	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but what about the right to receive care in an emergency?	STRIKE	not_statement
The rail strikes are yet another example.	STRIKE	not_statement
I have been contacted by constituents whose children are unable to get to school, commuters unable to get to work, and patients unable to see their loved ones in hospital or go to appointments.	STRIKE	not_statement
I support everyone’s right to travel, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	STRIKE	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but what about the rights of the self-employed?	STRIKE	not_statement
Are they not workers?	STRIKE	not_statement
What about the rights of small business employees?	SECURITY	not_statement
Are they not workers?	STRIKE	not_statement

What about cleaners, administrators or carers—or any worker in a sector not supported by unions?	EQUAL	not_statement
I was elected to this House to represent all my constituents, and that means protecting health services, education and livelihoods.	STRIKE	not_statement
In the light of union intransience to negotiate and modernise, minimum service levels are now needed, so I wholeheartedly support the Bill.	STRIKE	not_statement
I am genuinely appalled that the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	STRIKE	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights.	STRIKE	not_statement
I think we all know who it is really protecting.	STRIKE	not_statement
19:08:00  Vicky Foxcroft (Lewisham, Deptford) (Lab) Let me start by declaring an interest: I am a proud member of both Unite the union and GMB and, prior to being elected to this place, I worked for Unite the union for over a decade.	GENERAL	not_statement
Contrary to what some Conservative Members may have us believe, trade unions want their workplaces to thrive.	GENERAL	not_statement
They know that a productive workplace needs a happy, motivated workforce.	EQUAL	not_statement
They know that, when companies make large profits, they can ask for decent pay rises for their members.	WAGES	not_statement
When workplaces struggle, they will work with the employer to ensure it survives.	EQUAL	not_statement
We all know how public sector workers kept our country moving during the pandemic.	STRIKE	not_statement
They worked night and day to keep us safe, but how does this Government seek to repay them?	STRIKE	not_statement
First, with a derisory pay offer and then— because the unions have voted to strike, rather than roll over and accept the derisory pay offer—the Prime Minister has resorted to launching a fundamental attack on workers’ freedoms.	STRIKE	not_statement
This Bill is unworkable and impractical.	GENERAL	not_statement
Between 2010 and 2020, France lost almost six times as many days to strikes as the UK, and Spain lost more than twice as many.	STRIKE	not_statement
Ironically, we already have minimum service levels in place in the UK.	STRIKE	not_statement
I remember when I joined a picket line with striking firemen and women, and they told me how they had agreed with their employer that, if there was any fire or any other emergency, they would jump into the fire engines and be straight there.	STRIKE	not_statement
None of them wanted to see anyone lose their lives because of their action, which was their last resort.	STRIKE	not_statement
Most worryingly, the Bill does not give any indication of what will constitute a minimum level of service, meaning that the Secretary of State will be able to change that at their discretion.	STRIKE	not_statement
Having stretched public services and the workforce to breaking point, the Government’s solution is to create conditions in which workers can be forced into work and are unable to withhold their labour, no matter what the employee does.	GENERAL	not_statement
Is that really the kind of Britain of which we want to be part—one in which workers’ freedoms are being restricted to the extent that they could be sacked for standing up for their rights?	STRIKE	not_statement
Chris Loder What would the hon<prd> Lady say to those members of the RMT who decided to come back to work before Christmas because they did not agree with what the union was doing?	STRIKE	not_statement
Vicky Foxcroft That is democracy.	GENERAL	not_statement
Trade unions are subject to the most vigorous legislation when they are balloting and trade union money is the cleanest money in politics.	GENERAL	not_statement
Public sector workers are proud of the role they play in society, saving and protecting lives, but they need to be valued and their voices matter.	GENERAL	not_statement
When our NHS workers say they are worried about public health and the NHS, we need to listen, not curtail the right for their voices to be heard.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Government could and should have negotiated with the trade unions to get a decent settlement.	STRIKE	not_statement
They need to listen closely to the concerns that workers across the country have been raising.	WAGES	not_statement
I thoroughly believe that, when we work together, we achieve better outcomes.	STRIKE	not_statement
I defend their right to strike and I will be voting against this Bill.	STRIKE	not_statement
19:13:00  Laura Farris (Newbury) (Con) I would like to accept the invitation of the shadow Deputy Prime Minister, the right hon<prd> Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner), who encouraged us to be respectful in this debate.	GENERAL	not_statement
I wish to be so.	STRIKE	not_statement
We have heard a lot from the Labour party this evening about how the Bill is an act of political violence and an attack on the fundamental freedom of working people, but we have not heard an answer to the fundamental question that the legislation poses: do the British people have a right set out in statute to a basic safety and security guarantee during periods of strike?	GENERAL	not_statement
Let us start with the law.	GENERAL	not_statement
Joanna Cherry The hon<prd> Lady asks whether any of us on the Opposition Benches care about fundamental safety levels, and yes we do.	STRIKE	not_statement
She asked whether we would support legislating, but legislation already exists.	STRIKE	not_statement
On article 11, she knows as well as I do that the measures have to be “necessary”.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Government’s own memo with the last legislation said that the measures were not necessary in relation to the health service, education and fire and rescue.	STRIKE	not_statement
Laura Farris I thank the hon<prd> and learned Lady for her point, and I will assist her, because I was coming on to that point.	GENERAL	not_statement
The article 11 right may be restricted for two reasons—if the restriction is necessary, yes, and proportionate.	STRIKE	not_statement
The International Labour Organisation, of which the United Kingdom is a founding member, recognises that maintaining a minimum level of service provision can be both when it comes to essential services.	STRIKE	not_statement
Its committee on freedom of association has expressly set out the two circumstances in which it may be appropriate: where strike action would pose a risk to life, safety or health; or where the service is not essential in the strict sense of the word, but where repeated strikes would bring a very important sector to a standstill.	STRIKE	not_statement
Chris Stephens The ILO also says, does it not, that the minimum service level has to be agreed by an independent arbiter if there is a dispute, which is not in the Bill, and that there should not be a dismissal, which is in the Bill?	STRIKE	not_statement
Laura Farris I am grateful to both SNP Members for their interventions.	GENERAL	not_statement
I am coming on to those points, so I will make a tiny bit of progress, if I may.	GENERAL	not_statement
On the point raised by the hon<prd> and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry), we already know that transport and education meet the ILO’s test, because the ILO told the United Kingdom that in its response to the challenge to the Trade Union Act 2016 submitted by the TUC in 2015.	STRIKE	not_statement
In its response, the ILO committee of experts—Members can look it up; it is on the website—said that in relation to transport and education  “recourse might be had to negotiated minimum standards for these sectors as appropriate”.	STRIKE	not_statement
We also know that many comparable countries take a much tougher line than the Government are proposing.	STRIKE	not_statement
In the United States, to give one example, 38 out of 50 states ban public sector strikes altogether.	STRIKE	not_statement
Barry Gardiner (Brent North) (Lab) The hon<prd> Lady is presenting a reasoned case, but she knows, and she has just used the word, that these things should be negotiated.	STRIKE	not_statement
The measures in this Bill are by fiat of the Secretary of State.	GENERAL	not_statement
Laura Farris I thank the hon<prd> Gentleman for his point.	STRIKE	not_statement
I am coming to all these things, so if he will give me a moment, I will continue.	GENERAL	not_statement
In the United States, 38 out of 50 states have an outright ban on public sector strikes, including New York.	STRIKE	not_statement
Other states, such as Canada, Australia, Italy and Spain, all have embedded in statute minimum service levels that apply to important public services, and those services are often drawn much more widely than the Government are proposing.	STRIKE	not_statement
They include waste collection, postal services, broadcast services, the administration of justice, water distribution and energy supply.	 unions will need to obtain the active consent of members to deduct a political levy. At present	not_statement
I pick out those states not as random examples, but because every single one is a member of the International Labour Organisation.	STRIKE	not_statement
They are bound by exactly the same rules as us, and they are among our closest comparators around the world.	STRIKE	not_statement
Even more importantly, the International Labour Organisation has adjudicated all their statutory minimum service levels, and a 2019 publication from the ILO in Geneva commented:  “These examples illustrate the wide diversity of approach that ILO member states have adopted to address the challenges posed by industrial disputes in essential services”.	STRIKE	not_statement
Minimum service levels  “supported by the ILO’s supervisory organs, exist to manage the balancing act between these necessary restrictions and the individual worker’s fundamental labour rights”.	STRIKE	not_statement
I have not heard a single Member of Parliament tonight explain to me why the ILO is wrong or why the Government are striking the wrong balance when they have a mandate for what they are doing.	GENERAL	not_statement
Sam Tarry (Ilford South) (Lab) For example, the ILO imposes restraints on the circumstances in which such powers can be used, which is the antithesis of the Government’s blank cheque approach.	STRIKE	not_statement
Laura Farris With respect to the hon<prd> Gentleman, I take the opposite position.	GENERAL	not_statement
The United States has an outright ban on public service strikes in 38 states.	STRIKE	not_statement
In December, President Biden made his most recent intervention in union rights when he signed legislation that imposed an outright ban on a national railroad strike.	STRIKE	not_statement
The United States is a founder member, as we are, of the International Labour Organisation.	STRIKE	not_statement
It goes much further, but the ILO has found its ban to be lawful.	STRIKE	not_statement
19:20:00  Dawn Butler (Brent Central) (Lab) A lot of time is spent in courts in some countries arguing about minimum service level agreements.	STRIKE	not_statement
I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.	STRIKE	not_statement
I am a proud trade unionist: I worked for the GMB for more than a decade representing Members of Parliament, I am a member of Unite the union, and, after this debate, I might join a few more trade unions.	GENERAL	not_statement
The Secretary of State took great joy in reading out how much hon<prd> Members receive from trade unions, which is, as my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Vicky Foxcroft) said, the cleanest money in politics.	GENERAL	not_statement
I wonder if, when he returns to his place, he will let the House know how much Michael Green, Corinne Stockheath and Sebastian Fox have received in payments.	GENERAL	not_statement
In the short time that I have, I will talk about the Bill.	GENERAL	not_statement
It is dishonest; it is an insult to trade unions, which are the aspirational vehicle of the working class; and it is an insult to Parliament and parliamentary procedures.	STRIKE	not_statement
Most of the detail of the Bill is missing and the Government have said that they will add it later—that is not how we are supposed to do politics or make legislation.	GENERAL	not_statement
It allows the Government to amend and revoke any future legislation passed in this Session, so what is the point of Parliament?	STRIKE	not_statement
No matter what we say or pass, the Government can turn around and say, “We want to change it,” or, “We want to revoke it.	STRIKE	not_statement
” That is against what every single Member of Parliament has been elected to do.	STRIKE	not_statement
When I was a trade union official, it said on our office wall, “To make rich people work harder, they pay them more.	GENERAL	not_statement
To make poor people work harder, they try to pay them less.	WAGES	not_statement
” Safety does not appear anywhere in the Bill.	STRIKE	not_statement
The House of Lords debated a report, “Democracy Denied?	GENERAL	not_statement
”, which said that we must rebalance power between Parliament and the Executive.	GENERAL	not_statement
The Government are asking Parliament to vote on a Bill that does not really exist, because there is no detail.	STRIKE	not_statement
They are interested in trying to paint trade unions, which are the aspirational vehicle of the working class, in one light and themselves in another.	GENERAL	not_statement
19:24:00  Chris Loder (West Dorset) (Con) It is a pleasure to speak in the debate.	STRIKE	not_statement
I start by declaring that I am not a member of GMB, Unite the union or Unison—I apologise to Opposition Members if I have missed one out.	STRIKE	not_statement
My remarks relate to the transport industry, as I worked for the railways for 20 years before I was elected; indeed, I was previously a member of two trade unions.	STRIKE	not_statement
I warmly welcome this important Bill.	GENERAL	not_statement
Those of us who are, and have been, sensible and constructive trade union members know that we can still take strike action without closing down the whole network or shutting down an entire operation.	STRIKE	not_statement
[Interruption.	WAGES	not_statement
] I hear the moans of Opposition Members, but union members are fed up of being used as political pawns, which is why the strikes are breaking across the railway today.	STRIKE	not_statement
Individual members and individual areas are saying, “No.	 including the right to strike�	not_statement
Enough is enough.	GENERAL	not_statement
”  Florence Eshalomi Will the hon<prd> Gentleman give way?	GENERAL	not_statement
Sam Tarry Will the hon<prd> Gentleman give way?	GENERAL	not_statement
Chris Loder I am sorry; I will not give way to hon<prd> Members, because I have to crack on.	STRIKE	not_statement
These strikes are not a new or recent development.	STATUS	not_statement
There have been constant strikes for more than six months among some groups and, in some locations, they have actually been going on for years.	STRIKE	not_statement
We are seeing a rampant appetite for industrial action.	STRIKE	not_statement
We know that is the case, because RMT members have been striking against themselves in the last 12 months.	STRIKE	not_statement
Last week, at the Transport Committee, it became clear that the head of the train drivers’ union not only is a Labour party member, but has a top seat on its executive ruling body.	STRIKE	not_statement
There is a close relationship between the Labour party and the trade unions, which is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to individual Opposition MPs.	STRIKE	not_statement
Sam Tarry I thank the hon<prd> Gentleman for giving way and for being honest about his trade union membership.	STRIKE	not_statement
Chris Loder I remind the hon<prd> Gentleman that my remarks are about those in the transport industry who are in touch with me and those who represent them.	GENERAL	not_statement
I should say, however, that no teachers in my constituency have been in touch with me to tell me that.	GENERAL	not_statement
The Opposition should take note of that.	STRIKE	not_statement
I will bring my remarks to a close.	EQUAL	not_statement
As I was saying, the relationship between the unions and individual Opposition Members is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.	STRIKE	not_statement
The unions are showering the Opposition with hundreds of thousands—millions—of pounds as if it were confetti from the sky.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is absolutely outrageous.	STRIKE	not_statement
We have the privilege of being able to refer to the Register of Members’ Financial Interests when they speak in this House—that is all it takes.	GENERAL	not_statement
[Interruption.	WAGES	not_statement
] It is all there; I assure hon<prd> Members that there is no influence from trade unions in my entry.	GENERAL	not_statement
The irony is that we know that Opposition Front-Bench Members have accepted the TUC’s invitation to go to Spain to talk about such things with Spanish unions and to work out how disruption can be caused in this country.	GENERAL	not_statement
There is so much to expose, but I am afraid that I do not have any time left, otherwise I would be happy to say more.	GENERAL	not_statement
19:29:00  Owen Thompson (Midlothian) (SNP) It looks like being quite the week for the use of draconian anti-democratic powers by this Government.	GENERAL	not_statement
Turning their backs on the fundamental tenets of democracy really is something this Government are getting far too used to doing.	GENERAL	not_statement
The more they get a taste for it, the further they want to go.	STRIKE	not_statement
We saw the attack on devolution through the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020, and now we see them block a democratic decision rightly taken in Holyrood, cranking up the disrespect yet another notch.	GENERAL	not_statement
We see their anti-protest laws becoming even more authoritarian, with plans for the police to arrest campaigners before they even have a chance to commit a crime, and now we have their anti-trade union agenda being taken to the next level with these blunt powers being brought forward to stop strikes.	GENERAL	not_statement
The sweeping Henry VIII powers in the Bill, enabling Ministers to amend, repeal or revoke primary legislation not yet passed, should chill the heart of any democrat.	 a few months later	not_statement
It is ironic that a Government so keen to turn their back on Europe lean so heavily on their excuse, “But that is what other countries do”.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is also deeply disingenuous, and as Unison has rightly pointed out, countries being cherry-picked by the Government, such as Italy and France, come to voluntary agreements through collaborative processes and have far less restrictive measures in place than we currently see in the UK.	STRIKE	not_statement
Strikes are not the cause of the problems we face here; they are a symptom of the deep-rooted damage that has been done to our public service by this Government.	STRIKE	not_statement
The fact is that nobody downs tools without very good cause, especially during a cost of living crisis.	STRIKE	not_statement
Whatever motivation workers may have, they are under attack on all fronts by this Government, and I commend the unions for taking action to protect their members.	GENERAL	not_statement
If the Government continue to be determined to go down this destructive path, further damaging industrial relations, they must devolve employment law now, so that the Scottish Government have the powers they need to protect the rights of the people of Scotland from the damage of this Government.	GENERAL	not_statement
Workers are not just striking for themselves.	STRIKE	not_statement
This Bill should be refused any further consideration, and I urge every Member here tonight to stand against it and vote it down.	GENERAL	not_statement

I place on record my thanks to all public sector workers for the excellent work they have done—not just during the pandemic, but for many years prior to it.	GENERAL	not_statement
As we all know, the country is facing a difficult period of economic hardship.	GENERAL	not_statement
Yes, it is partly because of the war in Ukraine, and yes, it is partly because of our active response in the fight against the pandemic, but we need to be conscious that we are here to support workers, and not all workers are members of unions.	GENERAL	not_statement
As many Members will know—I have said this in this place before—while I represent quite a lovely constituency, public transport very much runs north and south, and when there are rail strikes, my constituents can get around only with extreme difficulty.	STRIKE	not_statement
While that may not necessarily hurt those who have the ability to access a car or, in extremis, pay for a little cab, those who we should be supporting the most are actually the ones most affected by this—the ones who are not able to use the bus to send their kids off to school or to get to their GP surgery for a doctor’s appointment.	STRIKE	not_statement
Reference has been made to the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, which I know has had a really tough time over many years.	STRIKE	not_statement
I would like to place on record my thanks that it was not one of the bodies that had a strike over recent weeks.	GENERAL	not_statement
Unfortunately, I have had to use its services over the last few weeks and months, and I know that it is literally saving lives in doing the excellent work it does in very difficult circumstances.	STRIKE	not_statement
One of the things I want to make the public aware of is that, post pandemic, we have adapted the way we work.	STRIKE	not_statement
Yes, we are very supportive of people such as rail workers, but the general population will adapt.	GENERAL	not_statement
I am a firm believer that we should be encouraging people to get back to work, which may mean commuting to London, as it does for a lot of my constituents.	STRIKE	not_statement
However, if that proves too difficult, they will just turn around and say, “Actually, we’ve already adapted, post pandemic, to working from home”.	STRIKE	not_statement
That means we will hollow out the urban areas of our country such as central London, where instead of a vibrant high street, as we have had with Victoria Street, we will very quickly have high street retailers, such as the Pret A Mangers of the world, closing up shop because they do not have the footfall to support them.	GENERAL	not_statement
Reference has been made to international comparisons.	GENERAL	not_statement
I for one think we have got the balance right with our support for workers, but also, counter to that, for wealth creators.	STRIKE	not_statement
As someone who comes from a small and medium-sized enterprise background, I know that I was fully reliant on one, two or three workers in, in my case, a furniture retail shop, to make sure the business could run, and I could not have done it without them.	STRIKE	not_statement
They were not part of a union, but 80% of our economy is reliant on SMEs, so while unions are excellent in the work they do for large public sector bodies, other workers out there are not members of a union.	GENERAL	not_statement
Mr Deputy Speaker Order.	GENERAL	not_statement
19:36:00  Sarah Owen (Luton North) (Lab) I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests and declare that I am proudly a trade union member, as will be no surprise to anybody.	STRIKE	not_statement
I will save the Secretary of State, who is no longer in his place, time and say that the donation to me three years ago was actually my final month’s salary from the GMB.	GENERAL	not_statement
I would rather have clean donations from trade unions any day over anything that the Conservative party receives from non-doms.	GENERAL	not_statement
The attacks on the rights and freedoms of our constituents are only becoming more apparent.	STRIKE	not_statement
We are all desperate for our public services to be stronger, faster, more effective and cost-efficient, but it is not the fault of the selfless and hard-working key workers in our health, rail and teaching sectors that public services are in the skeletal state they are or that nurses are having to use food banks.	STRIKE	not_statement
It is the fault of 13 years of Tory Governments.	GENERAL	not_statement
As for many others in this Chamber, the prosperity of public services and their workforce is personal for me.	GENERAL	not_statement
I was care worker, I worked in the fire brigade and I was a healthcare assistant doing shifts in hospitals.	WAGES	not_statement
I have also been a trade union member for nearly 20 years, and I have been a trade union officer working on pro-manufacturing campaigns, bereavement leave for foster carers, stopping the abuse of agency workers, training airport staff and ensuring survivors of domestic abuse are safe at work.	WAGES	not_statement
I say this not because it is particularly extraordinary, but because this is all in a day’s work for trade unionists, and Conservative Members should bear that in mind while they denigrate the work of trade unions.	STRIKE	not_statement
This is not just political; it is also personal.	GENERAL	not_statement
My partner works in education, while my father was a firefighter and my mother was a nurse.	GENERAL	not_statement
They took great pride in their work, and so they should.	STRIKE	not_statement
When we face crises personally or nationally, it is these workers we rely on to keep us safe, to heal us, and to protect our homes and our loved ones.	STRIKE	not_statement
Why then are this Government determined to punish those workers with real-terms pay cuts, job losses, worse terms and uncertain futures, yet still reward bankers with unlimited bonuses?	WAGES	not_statement
Not only are British public service workers seeing their pay declining or their jobs cut, they are now told that they cannot speak up about it.	STRIKE	not_statement
The message to public sector heroes from this Bill is: “Put up and shut up”.	STRIKE	not_statement
Unfortunately for this Government, that is not the spirit of this country or of the party of these Benches.	GENERAL	not_statement
Our constituents know the value of their work, and they know the dignity they deserve.	EQUAL	not_statement
When it comes to civil liberties, oh, the Conservatives talk a good game about freedom of speech, but on the basic rights to strike and to protest, this Government—one of the most extreme Tory Governments—are on the wrong side every time.	GENERAL	not_statement
They fight for the rights of holocaust deniers, climate change sceptics, and out-and-out misogynists to say whatever they like online, in an effort to appear anti-woke and pro-freedom of speech, yet when it comes to the freedoms of nurses, teachers, doctors, paramedics, firefighters, support staff and healthcare assistants, the Conservatives are not on their side, and they do not want them to have the same freedoms as everyone else.	GENERAL	not_statement
Ordinary working people such as the ones Ministers are now trying to gag fought for our rights—the right to maternity leave and bank holidays, the right to be safe at work and have equal pay, and the right to remove our labour.	STRIKE	not_statement
The right for people to have their voices heard when those in power are not listening.	GENERAL	not_statement
Time and again, the Tories show that they are on the wrong side.	STRIKE	not_statement
All they have to do is listen and negotiate.	GENERAL	not_statement
They are the reason why people need strong trade unions and a Labour Government, because the Tories will never be on the side of working people.	STRIKE	not_statement
I will always be on the side of working people, and I will vote against the Bill today.	STRIKE	not_statement
19:40:00  Ruth Edwards (Rushcliffe) (Con) That is what we are talking about.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Bill is not about views on the rights and wrongs of the current strikes.	GENERAL	not_statement

That package represents the first phase of formal public consultations on how best to put our plans into practice.	WAGES	not_statement

The insights gained have been invaluable in informing the amendments to ensure the Bill works in practice, both for workers and for businesses of all sizes across the whole country.	WAGES	not_statement
The amendments will strengthen the Bill, providing further detail and clarity on measures and ensuring such measures can be implemented in a straightforward way.	WAGES	not_statement
I turn to the detail of the amendments.	WAGES	not_statement
What is the answer?	GENERAL	not_statement
Justin Madders The answer is in the Department’s press release, which cites Simon Deakin, professor of law at the University of Cambridge, no less.	GENERAL	not_statement
He has said:  I am sure that the right hon<prd> Member wants to see that happen.	GENERAL	not_statement
Liam Byrne (Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North) (Lab) The Minister will have seen the appalling evidence that the Business and Trade Committee took from McDonald’s, where the BBC investigation exposed allegations from hundreds of young workers who were suffering harassment, and even allegations from one worker of managers soliciting them for sex in return for scheduling shifts.

Justin Madders I thank the Chairman of the Select Committee for his question.	STRIKE	not_statement
We are aiming to work on this once the Bill has passed this stage, and consultation will take place in due course.	STRIKE	not_statement
I have to say that the chuntering from those on the Conservative Benches really shows how they fail to appreciate the power imbalance that there is in some workplaces and the exploitation and harassment that arise from that.	EQUAL	not_statement

We know that 55% of agency workers requested a permanent contract with their hirer between January 2019 and September 2020, according to the Department for Business and Trade’s agency worker survey.	WAGES	not_statement
Given the important role that agency work plays in businesses and public services, we recognise the need to work with the recruitment sector, employers and trade unions to design detailed provisions for regulations that work—that is,  The Government have also tabled amendments in relation to dismissal and redundancy practices.

Sir Ashley Fox (Bridgwater) (Con) I had the good fortune to serve with the Minister for 21 sessions in Committee, and at the end of that we had a Bill 192 pages long.	WAGES	not_statement
We now have 270 pages of amendments, most of which come from the Government.	GENERAL	not_statement
Why are they tabling so many amendments and giving them just two days’ scrutiny?	STRIKE	not_statement
Are these just more union demands?	STRIKE	not_statement
Justin Madders I have literally just explained how we have been consulting with businesses and trade unions and put down amendments as a result.	STRIKE	not_statement
Of course, if the hon<prd> Member is concerned about the length of the amendment paper, he can withdraw his own amendment, which we will no doubt be debating later on.	GENERAL	not_statement
We are tabling some technical amendments to clause 21 on unfair dismissal that will update cross-references in other legislation to “the sum”, which is the existing cap on the compensation that can be awarded by an employment tribunal in most unfair dismissal cases.	SECURITY	not_statement
13:45:00 We have listened to feedback from business on the clause as introduced, which required consultation whenever 20 or more redundancies were proposed to be made across an employer’s organisation.	GENERAL	not_statement
Businesses told us that this would have put them in a constant state of consultation, The amendment means that collective redundancy obligations will be triggered where 20 or more redundancies are proposed at one establishment, in line with the existing law, or the number of proposed redundancies across the organisation meets a certain threshold.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Government will set this threshold out in due course via secondary legislation.	STATUS	not_statement
This could be a proportion of employees in a business, a suitable number of employees across a business, or some other threshold proposed through detailed consultation.	STRIKE	not_statement
Employers will also be required to notify the Government of redundancies that meet the threshold set in secondary legislation.	STRIKE	not_statement
New clause 34 will therefore double the protective award an employment tribunal can make from 90 to 180 days.	SECURITY	not_statement
We consulted on this and other matters from October to December 2024, and after listening carefully to a range of responses from businesses and employee representatives, we have concluded that the maximum period of the protective award an employment tribunal can make should be raised from 90 to 180 days.	SECURITY	not_statement
This is on top of changes that the Government have already made.	GENERAL	not_statement
From 20 January this year, employment tribunals have had the ability to uplift the protective award by up to 25% where an employer unreasonably failed to follow the code of practice on dismissal and re-engagement.	SECURITY	not_statement
We recognise that responsible employers up and down the country already go further than their current obligations to collectively consult and will continue to do so.	GENERAL	not_statement
The Government are also tabling amendments in relation to the Bill’s provisions on flexible working and dismissal during pregnancy.	STATUS	not_statement
Clause 22 adds a new power to make provisions for non-redundancy dismissals during or after the protected period of pregnancy.	SECURITY	not_statement
The amendments will add supplementary provisions to this power.	STATUS	not_statement
We will work with stakeholders on how to exercise these powers in regulations.	STATUS	not_statement
Amendment 79 to clause 7 proposes that the flexible working measures in the Bill be added to those provisions in scope of section 202 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.	STATUS	not_statement
That means that the security services—MI5, GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service—will be exempt from disclosing any information related to flexible working requests if, in the opinion of a Minister, it would be contrary to national security.	GENERAL	not_statement

The Government are moving amendments on statutory sick pay.	WAGES	not_statement
We launched a public consultation that asked employers, employees, trade unions, stakeholders and members of the public what percentage rate that should be.	GENERAL	not_statement
Today’s amendments will set the rate of statutory sick pay at 80% of an employee’s normal weekly earnings or the flat rate—whichever is lower.	WAGES	not_statement
Consequently, we will remove the previously proposed power for the Secretary of State to prescribe the percentage rate in secondary legislation.	GENERAL	not_statement
However, Ministers will still be able to use the existing power in section 157 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to substitute a different provision as to the weekly flat rate of SSP, or the percentage rate of the employee’s weekly earnings, depending on which is lower.

Chris Law (Dundee Central) (SNP) I apologise to the Minister because he has moved on, but I want to come back to the new level of statutory sick pay, which is £118<prd>75 or 80% of an employee’s weekly earnings.	WAGES	not_statement
An employee with weekly earnings of £125 would at present get £116<prd>75, but under the new model, they would receive only £100.	SECURITY	not_statement

Justin Madders Yes, but the hon<prd> Member forgets the fact that we are removing the waiting days.	GENERAL	not_statement

Wendy Morton (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con) The Minister is rattling off a whole list of amendments that appear to have come after the legislation has gone through Committee.	SECURITY	not_statement

Sir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con) In that consultation, how many small businesses expressed their support for the Bill?	GENERAL	not_statement
Justin Madders I refer the right hon<prd> Member to our departmental press release, where at least half a dozen business representatives and businesses have expressed support, and of course, there are many more businesses out there.	GENERAL	not_statement

These are not bit-part players at all, are they?	GENERAL	not_statement
New clause 38 seeks to ensure that agency workers in the adult social care sector who do not have a “worker’s contract”, within the meaning of employment legislation, would nevertheless be able to bring a claim in the employment tribunals or in civil proceedings where a fair pay agreement has been breached.

I am grateful to her Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.	EQUAL	not_statement
The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult and personal experience.	GENERAL	not_statement
I pay tribute to my hon<prd> Friend for showing great courage in talking about her personal experience of that.	GENERAL	not_statement
I am grateful to her and to other hon<prd> Members and campaigners for speaking about that issue—we have heard them.	EQUAL	not_statement
We fully accept the principle of bereavement leave for pregnancy loss, as addressed by the amendments.	WAGES	not_statement
We look forward to further discussions with my hon<prd> Friend and noble Lords as the Bill moves on to its stages in the other place.	GENERAL	not_statement
I will also take this opportunity to note the new clauses tabled by my hon<prd> Friends the Members for Poplar and Limehouse (Apsana Begum) and for Lowestoft (Jess Asato).	STRIKE	not_statement
The Government recognise the important points raised by both hon<prd> Friends, and the serious impact that domestic abuse has on society, particularly on women and girls.	GENERAL	not_statement
We strongly encourage employers to support staff who experience domestic abuse.	STATUS	not_statement
The Government have committed to halving violence against women and girls in a decade.	EQUAL	not_statement
I have met the Minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Birmingham Yardley (Jess Phillips), who is, as the House knows, a dedicated and respected campaigner on those issues.	STRIKE	not_statement
I have also spoken to several Members about their concerns, including my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Gloucester (Alex McIntyre), whose private Member’s Bill—the Domestic Abuse (Safe Leave) Bill—has been given its First Reading; my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Lowestoft; and the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Alex Davies-Jones).	GENERAL	not_statement
Members shared many powerful stories from their constituents.	GENERAL	not_statement
Every part of Government will need to contribute towards our ambition.	GENERAL	not_statement
Jerome Mayhew (Broadland and Fakenham) (Con) When my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Alison Griffiths) asked a moment ago which businesses support the Bill, the Minister mentioned the British Chambers of Commerce.	STRIKE	not_statement
I have just visited its website, which states:  “The British Chambers of Commerce has used an evidence session on the Employment Rights Bill to highlight businesses’ serious concerns about the legislation and the speed and detail of consultation.	GENERAL	not_statement
”  Will the Minister withdraw his comment?	STRIKE	not_statement
Justin Madders I am glad that the hon<prd> Member has access to the internet.	GENERAL	not_statement
I direct him to the Department’s webpage, where he will see that Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said:  “There is much here to welcome as sensible moves that will help ensure that employment works for both the business and the individual”.	GENERAL	not_statement
That was in response to the amendments, so it is a much more up-to-date comment than the one the hon<prd> Member mentioned.	STRIKE	not_statement
Returning to the important issue of violence against women and girls, it is incumbent on every part of Government to work together to tackle violence against women and girls.	EQUAL	not_statement
That is not a task for a single Department or Minister.	GENERAL	not_statement
The Government are steadfastly committed to delivering our manifesto commitment to halving violence against women and girls, and we will publish a cross-Government strategy shortly.	WAGES	not_statement
I intend to work with colleagues to ensure that our Department does its bit in that respect.	EQUAL	not_statement
I also take this opportunity to note the amendments tabled by my right hon<prd> Friend the Member for Sheffield Heeley (Louise Haigh) and the hon<prd> Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran) on non-disclosure agreements.	GENERAL	not_statement
I have met advocates on that issue and I understand the significant problems that they have highlighted in relation to the misuse of non-disclosure agreements in some circumstances.	SECURITY	not_statement
That important issue warrants further consideration.	STRIKE	not_statement
We take NDA misuse seriously and will continue to look into it to see what we can do.	GENERAL	not_statement
Sir Julian Smith (Skipton and Ripon) (Con) New clause 72, in the name of the hon<prd> Member for Leeds Central and Headingley (Alex Sobel), focuses on whistleblowing and protected disclosures.	SECURITY	not_statement
That area has been so important in recent public scandals, including the Post Office-Fujitsu scandal and the Lucy Letby case.	STRIKE	not_statement
May I urge the Minister to consider that new clause?	WAGES	not_statement
Employment Rights Bill: Employment Rates  Paul Holmes (Hamble Valley) (Con) 4.	GENERAL	not_statement
Whether she has had discussions with the Secretary of State for Business and Trade on the potential impact of the Employment Rights Bill on employment rates.	STRIKE	not_statement
The Minister for Employment (Alison McGovern) I meet regularly with Business and Trade Ministers.	STATUS	not_statement
We are committed to working with businesses to ensure that policy is pro-employer and pro-worker.	WAGES	not_statement
In fact, since I have been at the DWP, I have found that employers have not had sufficient contact from jobcentres and only one in six employers think about using them.	STRIKE	not_statement
That is what a real growth agenda looks like from DWP.	GENERAL	not_statement

Employment Rights Bill  Debate resumed.	GENERAL	not_statement
Gregory Stafford It is always a pleasure to follow the King.	GENERAL	not_statement
[Laughter.	WAGES	not_statement
] Nothing has highlighted more clearly than this debate the old adage that where we think the Labour party is wrong, it thinks that we are evil.	GENERAL	not_statement
Nothing that has come from Labour Members has given any consideration to the absolutely correct concerns that the shadow Minister, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith), raised in his opening remarks.	GENERAL	not_statement
Even the Government’s own impact assessment, which Opposition Members have mentioned on a number of occasions, concedes that business will face a staggering £5 billion in additional costs: an economic straitjacket that will choke innovation and job creation.	EQUAL	not_statement
Labour Members seem to have failed to realise that being pro-business, as the Conservatives are, is being pro-worker, because if businesses do not exist there will be no one to employ workers.	STRIKE	not_statement
In my constituency alone we have over 5,000 businesses, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises.	STRIKE	not_statement
Many of them operate in the education, retail and hospitality sectors, which rely on flexibility to survive, Lincoln Jopp (Spelthorne) (Con) Gregory Stafford My hon<prd> Friend makes a good point.	STRIKE	not_statement
I think of the University for the Creative Arts students who rely on flexible work and the NHS paramedic in Farnham picking up extra shifts at the Nelson Arms, as I mentioned earlier.	STRIKE	not_statement
UKHospitality has been clear that for 90% of workers on zero-hours contracts, that is their preference.	STATUS	not_statement
The sector relies on these contracts to manage fluctuating demand, and removing that flexibility could devastate those businesses and lead to job losses.	STATUS	not_statement
There is no job security for those who do not have a job.	STRIKE	not_statement
Similarly, the right to request flexible working must be assessed properly.	STATUS	not_statement
Madam Deputy Speaker, I fear the clock may not have started for my speech, so I will draw to a close.	GENERAL	not_statement

No, no; I am conscious of my hon<prd> Friends who wish to speak.	STRIKE	not_statement
This Government seem to have learned nothing from history.	EQUAL	not_statement
We have heard history lessons from Government Members, most of which have seemed to take us back to the 1970s.	GENERAL	not_statement
Economic success does not come from shackling businesses with red tape or giving trade unions unchecked power.	GENERAL	not_statement
It comes from fostering an environment where employers can hire, invest and grow.	STATUS	not_statement

Alison Bennett (Mid Sussex) (LD) Carers UK estimates that the value to the economy of carers being able to work is £5<prd>3 billion.	WAGES	not_statement
When I have met major blue-chip employers such as Centrica and HSBC, and their employees who have benefited from those corporations’ carers policies, The 2<prd>8 million people who juggle a job and caring responsibilities are going above and beyond to care for those they love while also contributing to our economy.	WAGES	not_statement
We must acknowledge their work with a fair deal for them.	WAGES	not_statement
I know that this is something the carers in my constituency deserve.	EQUAL	not_statement
They deserve better.	EQUAL	not_statement
We must be adaptable to the changing needs of our population while also seeing the benefits.	GENERAL	not_statement
This really can be a win-win.	STRIKE	not_statement
We know that being a carer makes people much more likely to fall into poverty.	WAGES	not_statement
Carers UK’s research also tells us that almost half of all those who left employment early to fulfil a caring responsibility say that they would have stayed in employment longer, had carer’s leave on a paid basis existed.	WAGES	not_statement
Mrs Russell I need to highlight to the House that I am a member of the Community and USDAW trade unions, and I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.	STRIKE	not_statement
I would like to speak to various bits of this legislation today.	GENERAL	not_statement
There is so much in it, and I know that so many of us on the Government Back Benches are really pleased with what we are bringing forward.	STRIKE	not_statement
The first part of the legislation that I want to address is clause 22, which will bring forward in future legislation more protections for women who are pregnant, on maternity leave and in the period immediately following their maternity leave.	SECURITY	not_statement
I have spent the past 13 years representing large numbers of women who were either made redundant while pregnant, on maternity leave or trying to come back from maternity leave, or whose employer suddenly woke up one morning and decided that they were underperforming, often within 24 hours of their announcing their pregnancy.	SECURITY	not_statement
I had a client who had been headhunted and brought into the company, was totally stellar, doing incredibly well and got promoted, but then announced her pregnancy and within a week she was on a performance plan.	WAGES	not_statement
HR explained to her that because they were, you know, kind and did not want to do that to her while she was pregnant, they were very generously offering her a settlement agreement so that she did not have to go through that.	SECURITY	not_statement
Lots of perfectly decent people do not understand why they are losing their jobs, and it is because they are pregnant.	SECURITY	not_statement
Pregnant Then Screwed found that 12<prd>3% of women who have had a baby have either been sacked, constructively dismissed or made redundant while pregnant, on maternity leave or within a year of their maternity leave ending.	SECURITY	not_statement
Lola McEvoy My hon<prd> Friend, who has great expertise in this area, is making an eloquent speech.	GENERAL	not_statement
The second element I like in the legislation is the improvements to the right to request flexible working.	STATUS	not_statement
Those on the Conservative Benches have questioned why we would do this.	GENERAL	not_statement
Conservative Members have talked a lot about clause 17 and the third-party harassment elements, and it is worth getting into some of the detail.	GENERAL	not_statement
The defence for an employer for failing to protect their staff from third-party harassment is taking all reasonable steps to prevent that harassment from occurring.	EQUAL	not_statement
Employment tribunals have been interpreting the meaning of “reasonable” for a long time, and in a discrimination claim there is essentially a three-part judiciary: a judge with legal experience, someone with employer experience, and someone with employee experience—sometimes from a trade union, but sometimes from elsewhere.	STRIKE	not_statement
Wera Hobhouse The hon<prd> Member is speaking powerfully.	WAGES	not_statement
Mrs Russell I completely and utterly agree with the hon<prd> Member.	STRIKE	not_statement
Actually, a lot of what is coming from Conservative Members is scaremongering.	GENERAL	not_statement
