"The Government firmly believe that the ability to strike is an important element of industrial relations in the UK. That ability is rightly protected by law, and we understand that an element of disruption is likely with any strike.",LEGAL,Grant Shapps
"However, we also need to maintain a reasonable balance between the ability of workers to strike and the rights of the public, who work hard and expect the essential services that they pay for to be there when they need them. We must be able to have confidence that when strikes occur, people’s lives and livelihoods are not put at undue risk. As has become clear from recent industrial action, that is not always the case, so we need a safety net in place to ensure that the public do not become collateral damage.",RELATE,Grant Shapps

"The Government are therefore absolutely clear: we want constructive dialogue with the unions, and the public have had enough of the constant, most unwelcome, and frankly dangerous, disruptions to their lives.",RIGHTS,Grant Shapps
it is perfectly proper to have a balance between minimum service levels and people’s right to strike.,RIGHTS,Grant Shapps
"Millions of people who rely on essential transport to get to work or to family commitments now every day have the extra stress of worrying about making alternative, sometimes costly, arrangements because of the forever strikes.",ECONOMIC,Grant Shapps
"That is why we need minimum safety and service levels to keep livelihoods and lives safe. It is frankly irresponsible, and even surprising, for the Opposition to suggest otherwise.",ECONOMIC,Grant Shapps
"It is fairly obvious to say that a minimum service level in railways, for example, is about people’s livelihoods rather than safety, but that the NHS and the ambulance service not agreeing nationally is a minimum safety level issue.",ECONOMIC,Grant Shapps
"The Bill will ensure that we protect the ability of workers to take industrial action, but that we also protect the public from disproportionate disruption to their daily lives and that, to put it simply, one person’s right to strike does not infringe on someone else’s right to life and limb.",ECONOMIC,Grant Shapps
"The reality is that safe agreements are negotiated between the staff and the employers. That happens on the ground, the process and the outcomes protect the NHS, because that is what staff want to do.",RELATE,Rachael Maskell
The Bill establishes a legal framework to implement minimum safety and service levels during periods of strike action.,RIGHTS,Grant Shapps
"The legislation will allow regulations to be made to ensure that specified services cannot shut down completely when workers strike. That is to maintain crucial and, in many cases, life-saving services. The relevant sectors specified in the proposed legislation are: health services, fire and rescue services, education services, transport services, decommissioning of nuclear installations and management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, and border security.",RIGHTS,Grant Shapps
"The human rights memorandum that accompanied the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill last October stated specifically that the Government’s legal advice was that it is not justifiable or necessary in a democratic society to have such restrictions in emergency and patient care services, in fire and rescue, or in education—only in transport.",RIGHTS,Joanna Cherry
"Ultimately, what people in our constituencies need to know, whether or not we know them, is that in those six sectors a minimum service will be provided regardless of the right of people in the sector to hold back their labour on a pay negotiation or for any other reason.",BALANC,Richard Graham
"Using the powers proposed in the Bill, regulations will set out the specific services within each sector in which a minimum level of service will be applied, they will also set out the levels themselves.",RIGHTS,Grant Shapps
"Those regulations will be tailored to each relevant service, taking account of the different risks to public safety or the impacts on daily life and on the economy.",BALANC,Grant Shapps
"Of course, the Government may choose not to use the regulation-making powers in the Bill if adequate voluntary agreements, where necessary, are already in place between employers, the relevant sectors and the relevant unions.

"We have an opportunity to keep people, their families and their jobs safe during periods of disruption, and that is what we intend to do.",PHYSICAL,Grant Shapps
The Bill and subsequent regulations are designed to enable employers to specify the workers required to meet minimum safety and service levels during strikes within relevant sectors.,PHYSICAL,Grant Shapps
"Should a union notify an employer of a strike in accordance with the existing normal rules, the Bill will allow the employer to issue a work notice to the union specifying the workers needed to work during a strike to secure the minimum level of safety and service.",RIGHTS,Grant Shapps
"Employers will be required to consult the union on the number of workers to be identified in the work notice and the work to be undertaken, and have regard to the union’s views before issuing that work notice.",COLLECT,Grant Shapps
The work notice must not list more people than reasonably necessary to meet the minimum level of safety and service.,RIGHTS,Grant Shapps
Employers must have no regard to whether someone is or is not a member of the union—or even the CLP—when deciding whether they need to be included in that work notice.,RIGHTS,Grant Shapps

The International Labour Organisation itself states that minimum service levels can be a proportionate way of balancing the right to strike with the need to protect the wider public.,BALANC,Grant Shapps
"On the claim of minimum safety levels across Europe, is the Secretary of State aware that, according to the OECD, France lost, on average, 112 days per 1,000 workers between 2008 and 2018? Spain lost 76 strike days, and Italy lost 42. Yet the UK lost only 20 strike days.",COMPAR,Florence Eshalomi

Workers who had failed to support industrial action reported being punished by colleagues who deliberately saddled them with antisocial shift patterns or isolated them in the workplace.

It is not acceptable for managers to harass and abuse trade union members who take lawful industrial action. Nor is it acceptable for strikers to treat those who choose to work in the same way.

It should be clear that such time should not  be used for political activities such as the organisation of strikes and political lobbying, but should meet the genuine need for union representatives to be involved in important HR issues between individual union members and employers.

"I suggest to the Minister that seeking to reduce facility time by publicising it, which does not take account of its exact nature, poses a risk that genuine HR matters may be unfairly neglected. I think that the Bill should clarify the position by making a subtle but important distinction between the sub-types of facility time, which should be carried through to the point of publication that the Bill stipulates. Such a clarification would surely be in line with the spirit of a measure that is, after all, designed to promote transparency and public scrutiny of facility time.",REPLIC,William Wragg

Instead it simply ensures that the right to strike is balanced with the rights of people who are affected by strikes and have no say in whether or not they will happen.

Does my hon. Friend agree that the context of this Bill is that it is intended to deal with the problem of a 77% increase in the loss of working days over recent times?

"The Bill dictates that industrial action, including strike action, will only be lawful if a minimum 50% turnout among those trade union members entitled to vote is achieved, while additionally requiring 40% of those members balloted to vote in favour of industrial action across what the Government term important public services. This term is of great significance. The Tory manifesto, as well as the subsequent Queens Speech briefings, stated that the 40% requirement would apply only to four essential public services: health, fire, transport and education services. Yet the Government have now extended this list to include other sectors, such as border security, the decommissioning of nuclear installations and the management of radioactive waste.",REPLIC,Alex Cunningham

Will the Minister give further details on the requirement for reasonably detailed information to be provided on ballot papers? If a failure to provide such information is to be a basis for legal action by employers against workers taking industrial action, it is crucial that the House should be informed in advance of how reasonably detailed is to be defined",ADEQ,Alex Cunningham
"The Bill will create substantial legal and administrative costs for unions, which will be required to report annually to the certification officer on levels of industrial action and on how political funds have been used.

"The Government claim to be the party of working people, but threatening the right to take industrial action tilts the balance of power in the workplace too far in favour of employers. It will mean that workers are unable to stand up for decent services and safety at work, or to defend their jobs or pay. It is clear that the Government are not interested in encouraging workplace democracy. Instead, they are attempting to prevent midwives, firefighters, teachers and cleaners from protesting  against cuts in jobs, pay and conditions.

Hertsmere is close to London, and when there is a tube strike or a  train strike, my constituents are massively adversely affected.",ECONOMIC,Oliver Dowden
"I am not saying that that should never happen, but the Bill will rightly set a balance in three important respects.
",BALANC,Oliver Dowden
"First, the Bill states that if a strike is to be called, there will have to be a vote of at least 50% in favour of it. If the strike action is to be taken by those working in core public services, such as transport or education, four out of every 10 people in that union will have to vote in favour of it. Contrary to the assertions of Labour Members, this will not stop strikes happening. Indeed, the latest analysis shows that between 50% and 60% of strikes would still go ahead under the new legislation, but we must rebalance the interests of the workers who are trying to serve their communities with those who are going on strike.",BALANC,Oliver Dowden
The second important principle relates to workers in my constituency and elsewhere who are members of trade unions but who do not necessarily share the goals of the Labour party.,POLIT,Oliver Dowden
"The truth is, however, that the legislation will not make any difference. The ballots held by ASLEF and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers have huge turnouts, and their members are expressing legitimate concerns about safety and manning levels that many of the travelling public share. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has used the tube recently, but the stations are being denuded of the human beings who used to be there to offer assistance. This measure will do nothing to help that position. In fact, it will make matters worse.",RIGHTS,Grahame Morris
"They cannot simultaneously say that this is an horrendous piece of legislation that will stop all strike action while also saying that it will have no effect. The hon. Gentleman should choose one line of argument or the other. Teachers would certainly be subject to the legislation, and their last strike would have been affected by measures such as these.",RIGHTS,Oliver Dowden
"People join unions for a variety of reasons, but they often do not wish to give money to the Labour party. There should be a simple principle that if a union wishes to give the party money, its members should be able actively to choose to do so, in much the same way as if they were making a direct donation to the party. I see no unfairness in that. I am simply saying that if people support the Labour party, they should be able to choose to give it money.",POLIT,Oliver Dowden
"Thirdly, the Bill works to redress the balance between striking and non-striking workers through the proposals to minimise the disruption caused by strike action. It is perfectly sensible to require 14 days notice of a strike. It would also be sensible, for example, that if the teachers at my daughters school were to go on strike, agency workers could be brought in so that my childrens education would not be disrupted.",BALANC,Oliver Dowden
"Similarly, it would be  sensible to bring in agency workers so that commuters from my constituency would not be disrupted by a transport strike. That would not be cost-free to the employer, who would have to pay high rates to employ agency workers at short notice.",REPLIC,Oliver Dowden
"Interestingly, given where the Labour party is at this stage, Labour Members have a choice: are they going to embrace the modern world and be on the side of workerspeople in their constituencies who go out to work every day and do not want to be disrupted or are they going to go back to the same old arguments that we thought had been settled 20 or 30 years ago? Interestingly, the measures taken then have never been repealed by the Labour party. I am absolutely clear which side I am on and which side the Conservative party is on. We are on the side of ordinary, hard-working people, while maintaining the right to strike. That is why I shall be voting in favour of this legislation.",BALANC,Oliver Dowden
"I also come here, however, as someone who knows that the most challenging situations and all the difficult discussions were entirely more productive and more effective, and carried more weight, because they were dealt with in partnership with trade unions. I did not always agree with my trade union counterparts, and they certainly did not always agree with me, but that is surely the point: sometimes there will be different perspectives, and that is entirely healthy and appropriate. It is clear that when tough decisions have to be made, communication is the key to an effective and productive workplace culture. We do need to accept, however, that occasionally we will not agree, no matter how much discussion we have hadthat is a fact of lifeand no Bill will make employers and staff agree on everything.",RELATE,Kirsten Oswald
"What this Bill will do is: ensure that any disagreement is squashed by management, without any constructive dialogue, render any dialogue that there is futile, and ensure that the important and constructive voices of staff are lost, drowned in a welter of arguments about  minutiae of process or brushed aside. This Bill is a recipe for turning disagreement into conflict, and for escalating a short-term problem into a fundamental break in relationships in the workplace.",RELATE,Kirsten Oswald
"Interfering in the employment relationship with this restrictive and provocative Bill is a backward step. It appears to be driven more by ideology, and by malice towards trade unions and their members, than by any desire to improve industrial relations",POLIT,Kirsten Oswald
We have already heard about the leading academics in industrial relations who wrote to the newspapers describing the proposals as draconian and perverse.,JUST,Kirsten Oswald
"They recognise the positive contributions of unions to performance, improvement and innovation in the workplace, and they decry the Governments proposals as undermining the ability of unions to protect terms and conditions, and leading to the loss of employee voice.",AUTONOMY,Kirsten Oswald

it will feed into the labour market by increasing endemic low pay and insecure terms and conditions of employment among non-unionised workers.",ECONOMIC,Kirsten Oswald

The Bill introduces unnecessary new and complex bureaucracy: it will increase costs for unions and employers, as legal disputes develop, and it undermines social justice.",AUTONOMY,Kirsten Oswald
The issues that affect people in a strike come from a breakdown in a partnership between those who operate businesses and the people who work within them. ,RELATE,Richard Fuller
"In the last four years of the last millennium1996 to 1999there were 199,000 days lost from private sector strikes, compared with 278,000 from public sector strikes. In the past four years2010 to 2014the number for the private sector had more than halved, to 74,000, whereas the figure for the public sector had more than doubled, to 573,000. Something in this consensus is working in the private sector but not working so well in the public sector. A particular issue is that in three of the past five years one area of the public sector, education, accounted for more than 50% of public sector strikes.",ADEQ,Richard Fuller
"First, on the issue of the 40% additional threshold, I am pleased that the Government are looking at consultation, but the points made about the ability of the union leadership to control and minimise wildcat strikes do carry quite a weight. It would be interesting for the Minister to consider whether the notice period of 14 days before strike action will achieve most of the goals that are seen as required for that 40% threshold. May I encourage the Minister to include in clause 6(1), on information to the certification officer, a provision about the outcome of the industrial action? That information is useful for members, too. If they are asked to go on strike, they should know what the consequence of the strike waswhat they achieved by itso they can see whether such action is playing a good role.",REPLIC,Richard Fuller
"There are extensive new roles for the certification officer, and business would like to be assured that this will not lead to additional disclosure requirements on business in the future. An industrial dispute still has two sides, one may be out on strike but the other side is dealing with that strike. We are placing information requirements on the trade union, but will there be a need for any similar information requirements on or disclosure by business?",ADEQ,Richard Fuller
"will the ministerial team listen carefully to the points that have been made, because we do not want trade unionists going about their business in towns across the country inadvertently finding themselves criminalised? I am sure that that, on its own, would undermine the consensus.",RELATE,Richard Fuller
"This is a Bill of naked discrimination against the trade unions, designed to cut the funding of the Labour party severely and, thus, to entrench the Tory party in power, as well as to make it almost impossible to strike in certain industrial sectors.",POLIT,Michael Meacher
"However, it is worth quoting the stated purposes of the Bill, which the Government pretend are their motives. The first is to

pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by 2030.

That is beyond satire. The truth is that after seven years of austerity following the great crash wages are still 6% below pre-crash levels, productivity is flat, the FTSE 100 companies are not investing and household debt is now tipping 2 trillion. The idea that after this Bill we will be overtaking Germany and the United States in the next 15 years is ludicrous.
",ECONOMIC,Michael Meacher
"The Governments second reason for this Bill is to

ensure hardworking people are not disrupted by little-supported strike action.

The best answer to that was that given by The Times commentator, Philip Collins, on the day the Bill was presented, on 15 July. He said:

Strike action, fox hunting, the BBC, Europe, migrant benefits. The Tory ability to identify things that are not problems, then attack them.",BALANC,Michael Meacher
"The truth is that the number of days lost to strike action now is less than one tenth of what it was in the 1980s. Of far greater importance to the state of the economy is the chronic underinvestment in skills. This Bill, while obnoxious, is utterly irrelevant to the key problems of this country. The tube workers aside, only teachers and firefighters have caused any real national concern since 2010, and even they normally did so only one day at a time. Even the resistance of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers to plans for keeping the underground open all night are not that unreasonable. Night shifts are unsociable, unhealthy and potentially dangerous as they lead to over-tiredness. But the central point here is not acknowledged in the Bill. The Government seem to believe that whenever a strike occurs, it is always the fault of the workers irrespective of what the employer has done.",RELATE,Michael Meacher
"It is true that most employers are probably decent and reasonable, but there are a distinct minority of them who are intransigent and who behave thoroughly unreasonably and badly. To penalise and intimidate workers in such cases, when it is the employer who has overwhelmingly caused the breakdown in industrial relations, is wholly unfair and wrong.",RELATE,Michael Meacher
"The last thing that the workers want to do is to go on strike, but when they have genuine, reasonable and pressing demands over such essential issues such as job losses, safety problems and pay, and those demands are swept to one side, as they often are, with little or no negotiation, they have no alternative but to take industrial action. To blame and penalise them and not bad management, as the Tory party and its pals in the media automatically do, is a total charade.",RELATE,Michael Meacher

Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson) talked about inconvenience of the strike, but the truth was that there was massive disruption that cost tens, if not hundreds, of millions of pounds.

I declare my interest as a member of Unite the union. The Bill exposes the Governments self-appointed title as the workers party and their claim to be the party for working people as little more than empty rhetoric devised by the spin doctors at Tory HQ.

"Trade unions have been an essential force for social progress, without which a semblance of a decent and humane society is impossible under capitalism.

The trade union movement in the UK, independent of the Labour party and with the Labour party, is responsible for the fundamental gains of working people, many of which we now take for granted, including the weekend, maternity leave, the national health service and the national minimum wage.",JUST,Andy McDonald
The role of trade unions in society as a counterweight to the pressures of capital is essential for the protection of decent standards of living as well as a driver of economic growth. ,ECONOMIC,Andy McDonald
"The Government are carrying out this attack on trade unions not for practical reasons supported by evidence, but out of their ideological commitment to fighting the battles of generations past and to pursuing their mission to weaken and destroy the labour and trade union movement.",POLIT,Andy McDonald
"Let us make no mistake about it, the purpose of requiring union members to opt in to political funds is to attack and damage the finances of the Labour party so as to make the Conservative partys financial advantage even greater than it already is. If this Bill passes, it would break a long-standing consensus in British politics that the Government should not introduce partisan legislation unfairly to disadvantage other political parties.",POLIT,Andy McDonald
"Even Margaret Thatcher, a Prime Minister whose term was defined by her opposition to the trade union movement, considered the proposals such as the ones set out in this Bill to be too extreme. She said that

legislation on this subject, which would affect the funding of the Labour party, would create great unease and should not be entered into lightly.",COMPAR,Andy McDonald
These proposals are so unreasonable and extreme that they will undoubtedly raise the serious prospect of legal challenge. The interference of the state in the affairs of trade unions is counter to article 11 of the European convention on human rights. We are signatories to the European social charter and as a nation we agreed in article 5 that our national laws would not restrict the freedom of workers to form and join organisations for the protection of their economic and social interests. The Bill directly contravenes our countrys commitment under the charter.,LEGAL,Andy McDonald

"It is worth remembering, of course, that many of those functions are now fulfilled by Parliament, it has legislated for a national minimum wage, provision for sickness and holiday payments, protection against unfair dismissal and so on. Therefore, many of the injustices that trade unions quite rightly fought against at the outset have now been dealt with by Parliament.",ADEQ,Chris Philp

Strikes have a profound effect on other members of society, which is why it is appropriate to put in place a reasonable threshold before strike action can be taken. For example, exactly a year ago Unisons NHS staff voted for strike action on a turnout of 16% and with 11% of the membership voting in favour. I do not think that mandate is strong enough to merit inconveniencing tens of thousands of patients and potentially having operations postponed.",BALANC,Chris Philp
"Furthermore, since 2008 there have been 26 strikes on the London undergroundI am a London MP, and I have lived in this city all my life. Anyone who claims that the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers does not strike lightly has not tried to travel in this city during one of those 26 strikes. I point out that 19 of those strikes would not have happened under this legislation.",ADEQ,Chris Philp
But does the hon. Gentleman accept that those strikes have tripled since the Tories took over in London in 2008? It is an absolute disgrace that the Mayor of London has never sat down and met the trade unions and treated them as though they were equal partners or human beings in the same race.,RELATE,Catherine West

I remind those Members who oppose the Bill that a YouGov poll conducted only four weeks ago found that 53% of Londoners are in favour of these measures and only 26% are opposed.,JUST,Chris Philp
"Moreover, I challenge  the assertion made by some Opposition Members that union activity does not stoke excessive strike action. It is instructive to compare days lost due to strike action in the private sector, where union membership is relatively low, with days lost in the public sector, where union membership is more widespread. We find that last year the number was 40 times higher in the public sector than it was in the private sector, despite the fact that terms and conditionspay, holidays and so onare, if anything, slightly better in the public sector.",POLIT,Chris Philp
"I would like briefly to address the issue of facility time. The TaxPayers Alliance[Interruption]which clearly commands widespread support on the Opposition Benches, has calculated that the effective subsidy to unions from the public purse as a result of facility time is 108 million every year. The unions do not necessarily need that moneythey have plenty of money to make political donations withand it is not reasonable for the public purse to fund what is often party political activity.

"Why are we debating the Bill today? Is there any urgency for these provisions, or any demand resulting from the parliamentary timetable? No, there is not. We all know why we are here today. We are here today because the Government deliberately timetabled the Bills Second Reading to coincide with the first full day of the Trades Union Congress, when those MPs who are proud trade unionists, as I am, would have been in Brighton talking with working people about the issues that really matter, such as low pay, zero-hours contracts, inequality and insecurity at work. Instead, we are here to discuss this shabby, shameful Bill. That shows the Governments contempt not only for trade unions, but for democracy.

"The Bill was published on 16 July. Consultations were scheduled to take place over the summer recess and closed only five days ago. This debate was scheduled for today even though the Bill is incomplete and the Government have accepted that it will require many amendments. The clearest example of that is on the deduction of union subscriptions. On 6 August the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General announced the Governments intention

to abolish the practice of checkoff across all public sector organisations.",REPLIC,Jo Stevens
"He announced that those changes would be in the Bill, so where are they? Where are the proposals and the draft clauses? They are nowhere to be seen. There is neither a timetable for publication of those clauses, nor a commitment  to any period of consultation. The Bill is a disgraceful attack on the right of employers and unions to freely negotiate arrangements that best secure constructive industrial relations.",RELATE,Jo Stevens
" We recognised a trade union to represent our staff, to collectively bargain on their behalf, to represent their interests and to ensure that we could discuss with them any changes necessary for the continued success of the business in the best interests of staff. To do that, we had check-off and facility time in place. As we have heard from many Members today, deductions from payroll are a common way for employers to help employees with regular payments. Many Members make payments to charity through our payroll and the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. It is good enough for them, but it seems that it will not be good enough for trade union members. Check-off arrangements worked for us as an employer and for our staff, and it was freely agreed. Many employers in both the private and public sectors feel the same.

But I would go further. It is an unnecessary, dangerous and flawed Bill.",REPLIC,Jo Stevens

"In British society, we all depend on public services in our daily lives. Parents rely on schools to be open. They cannot put their children into another one if their school is closed by a strike. Patients rely on hospitals to be open. They cannot go elsewhere for the appointment they have waited for anxiously. People rely on trains and buses to get them to work on time. They cannot use another train or bus company if their local service has been shut down by a strike. As the Mayor of London, my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson) pointed out, most of the people travelling on public transport are paid much less and work much longer hours than those people driving it.",BALANC,Nick Boles
"As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Oliver Dowden) argued so powerfully, it is only reasonable to reassure his constituents, my constituents and those of every hon. Member that a strike that forces them to take a day off or to pay for expensive childcare, that makes them late for work or that makes them miss a long-awaited check-up was the result of a recent vote by a decent proportion of union members and not a vote taken several years ago in which only a small minority supported strike action.",BALANC,Nick Boles
"I would now like to answer some of the points made during the debate. The shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle), who I welcome  to her place, suggested that the Bill gives the Government powers to add new sectors to the ballot provisions by secondary legislation. That is not the case. There is a power to restrict within the existing sectors those groups of employees to whom the threshold should apply and we have consulted on which groups of employers within those six sectors it should apply to, but there is no power to expand it further.",RIGHTS,Nick Boles
"My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis) raised some concerns about the picketing code, and those concerns were reflected in other speeches, too. I am a little puzzled by those concerns because the clauses in the Bill on picketing were taken directly, word for word, from the code on picketing, a statutory code that has existed since 1992, which the previous Labour Government made no attempt to amend and which no union has ever written to me to ask me to amend.",COMPL,Nick Boles
"My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) raised the question of e-balloting, and he is right that there is no in-principle objection to the idea of voting online. The objection is practical. In January 2015, the Open Rights GroupI think that it believes in open rightsgave evidence to your Commission on Digital Democracy, Mr Speaker, in which it said:

Voting is a uniquely difficult question for computer science: the system must verify your eligibility to vote, know whether you have already voted, and allow for audits and recounts. Yet it must always preserve your anonymity and privacy. Currently, there are no practical solutions to this highly complex problem and existing systems are unacceptably flawed.

If the Opposition can find a practical solution, I look forward to hearing it.",REPLIC,Nick Boles
"My hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (William Wragg) made an important point, with which I entirely agree. In asking public sector bodies to measure the amount of money spent on facility time, we must distinguish between union duties, on which it is entirely proper for union members and union representatives to work, and union activities, in which case it might not be so proper for them to be paid while doing them.",ECONOMIC,Nick Boles
"This once great movement has become a left-wing sect in thrall to union leaders who have become ever more extreme while their membership declines. It falls to us as Conservatives to stand up for working people in every part of this great nation. It is this Conservative Government who are investing in apprenticeships, creating millions of jobs and ensuring that work always pays.",POLIT,Nick Boles

"I happen not to have received any money from the GMB, although I would be proud to do so—certainly a lot prouder that I would be of receiving £2<prd>5 million from Lubov Chernukhin.",not_statement,
Can the Secretary of State confirm that this legislation cannot possibly be used to sort out the present winter of discontent?,not_statement,
"If anything, it will make it far more difficult to secure a resolution of any of the individual strikes, and therefore it is just political posturing.",not_statement,
Grant Shapps I think the GMB will have heard the hon<prd> Gentleman’s pitch for some money.,not_statement,
"If he gets that money, it will join the £120 million that the unions have supplied to the Labour party since 2010.",not_statement,
I make this point only because it is relevant to today’s debate.,not_statement,
"We must be here to represent our constituents, and our constituents know from paying attention to the recent strikes that when the Royal College of Nursing worked with the NHS, it was able to provide timely assurances at a national level to ensure that the most critical services—including chemotherapy, critical care, paediatric and A&amp;E—were not affected, which shows that even when parties disagree, they can do so in a mature manner.",not_statement,
"Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case.",not_statement,
"During recent strike action by the ambulance service—this has been referred to a couple of times, and I want to read it out because it is written down—the NHS has not been reassured by the relevant union that it can rely on the current system of voluntary local derogation, which I think is what the hon<prd> Member for York Central was talking about earlier.",not_statement,
It could not rely on those arrangements to ensure that patient and public services were provided.,not_statement,
"Last week, and in December, arrangements were being disputed right up to the wire—right up to the last minute—which created uncertainty and left officials with little time to organise contingency measures such as military support.",not_statement,

This Government will not stand by and watch that happen.,not_statement,

"The question is: why and how have the Government arrived at that decision now, in advance of the legislation itself?",not_statement,
"Grant Shapps It is because we were given adequate demonstration from the recent strikes that unfortunately in some cases the unions involved have not acted in the national interest, whereas others—the RCN, for example—have very much done so.",not_statement,
"I want to stress what I said at the top of my speech, which is that I do not want us to have to use this legislation if it is not required.",not_statement,

"I know from talking to colleagues and officials that one of the problems was that, because of the late notice and the randomised trust-by-trust agreements, they have been unable to put in a national framework that would mean that it would not matter if you lived in Islington North or somewhere else; you would still get coverage on strike days.",not_statement,
Nadia Whittome Does the Secretary of State see the irony in expecting unions to ensure minimum safe service levels on strike days when his own Government are failing to do so on every other day?,not_statement,
What does he make of nurses’ reports that staffing levels are in fact safer on strike days because the unions are negotiating appropriate cover compared with non-strike days?,not_statement,
Grant Shapps I did not quite follow the hon<prd> Lady’s point on the railways.,not_statement,
"The railways on strike days are finding it hard to offer any services at all, even for key workers and the people the Opposition sometimes claim to represent the most, such as the hard-working cleaner or the hospital porter.",not_statement,
The people who cannot do their jobs remotely are unable to get to their jobs and they are losing money.,not_statement,
They are becoming fed up with the forever strikes where the unions simply will not put the offer to their members in order for the members to have a say.,not_statement,

"I have been a Member of this House for some seven years now, and I cannot recall a measure that is at once so irrational and so insulting.",not_statement,
"We will oppose the sacking of nurses Bill, and it is not just about nurses but about the many key workers who we clapped and who kept our services going in the face of the pandemic.",not_statement,
"We will vote against this legislation tonight, and the next Labour Government will repeal it.",not_statement,
We are in the middle of an economic crisis of the Government’s making.,not_statement,
Working people are facing the largest fall in living standards in a generation.,not_statement,
[Interruption.,not_statement,
"] The Secretary of State keeps shouting “Putin”, but what about Liz Truss?",not_statement,
Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton) Order.,not_statement,
Angela Rayner What about the Conservatives crashing the economy?,not_statement,
The Secretary of State forgets the fact that inflation has gone through the roof under their watch.,not_statement,
Thirteen years of Conservative failure.,not_statement,
"Members watching this debate and constituents up and down the country know the truth, and they will tell this Government what they think, come the next general election.",not_statement,
Working people are facing the largest fall in living standards in a generation.,not_statement,
"In-work poverty, insecure work and financial insecurity are rampant.",not_statement,
Inflation is in double digits.,not_statement,
"It is in this context that we have seen the greatest levels of strike disruption in 33 years, with ambulance workers taking their first major strike action in decades and the first ever strike in the history of the Royal College of Nursing.",not_statement,
"Our posties, train drivers, Border Force, health workers, train cleaners and even Ministers’ own officials have taken action too.",not_statement,
"The Prime Minister will not admit it, but this is a crisis and it is a crisis of the Government’s making.",not_statement,
This legislation does nothing to resolve the problems that they have caused.,not_statement,
There is no common sense in it at all.,not_statement,
Kim Leadbeater (Batley and Spen) (Lab) I declare an interest as a proud trade union member.,not_statement,
Does my right hon<prd> Friend agree that this legislation does nothing to address the underlying reasons NHS staff and others have taken the incredibly difficult decision to strike?,not_statement,
"We are going to spend a number of hours in here this evening, but surely that time would be much better spent by the Government getting round the table with members of the NHS, listening to their concerns and coming to a resolution that would help to move things forward, rather than wasting our time here this evening on this horrible piece of legislation.",not_statement,
Angela Rayner I thank my hon<prd> Friend for that contribution and I absolutely agree.,not_statement,
"I was reflecting while the Secretary of State was making his opening speech, and I was thinking that, if I still worked in social care or one of the key public services—if I was paramedic, a nurse or one of those key workers he mentioned—and I was listening to this debate, I would be really upset and offended by the way he represented them here today.",not_statement,
That is not what the Labour party thinks of those key workers.,not_statement,
"The Secretary of State has claimed that this legislation is about public safety, so why does the Bill not mention safety once?",not_statement,
"He knows full well that working people already take steps to protect the public during strikes through derogations and voluntary agreements, yet he brazenly claims that this punitive legislation is needed because of ambulance workers.",not_statement,
"That is insulting and shameful, and I think he should apologise for the way in which he has awfully smeared ambulance workers.",not_statement,
Chris Stephens (Glasgow South West) (SNP) I thank my Unison comrade for giving way.,not_statement,
"I am not a member of the parliamentary Labour party, but I am a proud trade unionist.",not_statement,
This Bill is therefore completely unnecessary.,not_statement,
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my friend.,not_statement,
"We may not be in the same party, but we are in the same trade union.",not_statement,
"These brave, hard-working men and women struck local life-and-limb deals on a trust-by-trust basis ahead of all the strikes.",not_statement,
[Interruption.,not_statement,
"] The Secretary of State says it is trust by trust, but it is the best way to ensure that the right care is provided, and those employers know that.",not_statement,
"When I was a home help, we always put patient care first.",not_statement,
"We negotiated to ensure minimum safety levels, which is more than I can say for the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, under whose watch we have seen excess deaths and an increasing crisis in the NHS.",not_statement,
"Ellie Reeves (Lewisham West and Penge) (Lab) I, too, declare an interest.",not_statement,
"As a proud trade unionist and trade union lawyer for many years before entering Parliament, I represented striking workers day in, day out.",not_statement,
I know that no worker takes the decision to strike lightly.,not_statement,
These strikes have been caused by the cost of living crisis caused by this Conservative Government.,not_statement,
"Does my right hon<prd> Friend agree that this Bill is just a further attack on workers’ rights, like the anti-trade union legislation passed by this Government in 2016?",not_statement,
"It is just another attack on working people who keep us safe, day in and day out.",not_statement,
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree.,not_statement,
"People watching this debate can see from the Secretary of State’s opening remarks, and from his previous remarks, what this is: a smokescreen about allegedly needing minimum service levels.",not_statement,
"We know that because, last autumn, his own Government assessed that minimum service levels were not needed for the emergency services due to existing regulations and voluntary arrangements.",not_statement,
"This is an attack on every nurse, health worker and firefighter in the country.",not_statement,
They have gone from clapping nurses to sacking them.,not_statement,
"Charlotte Nichols My mam is a member of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, as I have previously noted in the House.",not_statement,
"It is interesting to hear what the Secretary of State says about the need for this Bill and legislation more widely because he was previously Secretary of State for Transport, and the only negotiations that have not been settled with the RMT are the ones in which the Department for Transport is involved.",not_statement,
Every other dispute with the RMT has been resolved.,not_statement,
So is this Bill not just covering up his failure to negotiate basic trade union agreements?,not_statement,
Angela Rayner My hon<prd> Friend makes some important points.,not_statement,
"We can all see from the reports on the negotiations that there was genuine hope we could get to a settlement, and then the Government decided to bring in new conditions at the last minute to make sure that the dispute continued.",not_statement,
"It is the Government, not the trade unions, who are acting militantly and who do not want to resolve these disputes.",not_statement,
"The Government should also reflect on the key workers and other workers who will be affected by this strike action, and who the Secretary of State says are putting lives at risk.",not_statement,
"Even if they are not a key worker, I am pretty certain that most people, like my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Warrington North (Charlotte Nichols), have a friend, relative or someone they know who is.",not_statement,
"We all think they are heroes, and we all know they have their patients, the people they look after and the services they provide at the forefront of their mind.",not_statement,
"No one wants to take strike action, least of all the workers who lose a day’s pay.",not_statement,
"I have long urged Ministers to do their job and resolve the underlying problems, but instead they have presented a Bill that tries to remove hundreds of thousands of workers’ historic right to withdraw their labour.",not_statement,
It is not just wrong in principle; it is unworkable in practice.,not_statement,
"Dan Carden (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab) I declare my interest as a proud trade unionist.",not_statement,
"I meet striking workers on an almost weekly basis at the moment, and I know that working people are often targeted by employers during a dispute.",not_statement,
This Bill hands employers the right to decide which worker goes to work and which worker can go on strike.,not_statement,
Does my right hon<prd> Friend share my concern that this could allow bad bosses to victimise and target workers?,not_statement,
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my hon<prd> Friend.,not_statement,
This legislation  “is not a solution to dealing with the industrial action we see at the moment.,not_statement,
”  Those are not my words but the words of the Transport Secretary in December.,not_statement,
This Bill could increase the frequency of strikes and the  “numbers of staff taking action short of striking”  and lead to employers finding that they are “low on staff.,not_statement,
"” Again, those are not my words but the words of the Department for Transport’s impact assessment.",not_statement,
Minimum service levels are “not a game-changer” and could  “promote more industrial action than they mitigate.,not_statement,
”  That is not me speaking but the senior Conservative adviser who developed the policy.,not_statement,
The jury is in.,not_statement,
"These measures will not work, cannot work and will only make things worse.",not_statement,
"James Sunderland (Bracknell) (Con) I remind the House that we have a number of sectors in the UK in which employees are not allowed to strike, namely the armed forces and the police.",not_statement,
May I ask the right hon<prd> Lady to present an argument for why this provision should not be extended elsewhere?,not_statement,
Angela Rayner I am glad the hon<prd> Gentleman got the crib sheet from the Whips.,not_statement,
There is a complete and utter lack of clarity about what these measures will mean for the six sectors to which they will apply.,not_statement,
"In nuclear decommissioning, for example, staff already have voluntary arrangements.",not_statement,
How will Ministers define minimum service in this sector?,not_statement,
Will they require just a teeny bit of decommissioning?,not_statement,
What about health?,not_statement,
"Will Ministers seriously sack doctors, nurses, paramedics and vital support staff at a time of critical NHS staff shortages?",not_statement,
"Apparently not, if the Government sources reported this week can be believed.",not_statement,
"Does the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy deny that the Health Secretary has told others to lobby the Prime Minister for improved pay offers?",not_statement,
And can he really say that the Health Secretary believes this Bill will help the NHS?,not_statement,
"The Bill states that all transport services will be covered, but the industry is largely in the private sector.",not_statement,
"Does the Secretary of State expect, for example, self-employed cabbies to serve work notices to themselves?",not_statement,
"There seem to be a split here, too; I hear that the Transport Secretary has given rail companies permission for new pay offers, and we already know his views on minimum service levels.",not_statement,
Let us move on to education.,not_statement,
Will our overstretched headteachers be forced to write and serve work notices in their own staffrooms?,not_statement,
Does the Business Secretary agree with the Education Secretary that imposing these regulations on schools would be a hostile act?,not_statement,
Let us turn to fire and rescue services.,not_statement,
Has austerity not already made it impossible for some services to meet existing contingency regulations as it is?,not_statement,
"Will the Business Secretary of State leave it there, or will he just go for broke and ban all key workers from joining a union at all?",not_statement,
That is something we know his desperate Prime Minister has been considering.,not_statement,
Brendan Clarke-Smith (Bassetlaw) (Con) The right hon<prd> Lady mentions the issue of pay and speaking to unions to resolve this dispute.,not_statement,
"Can she tell us what level of pay she thinks, and the Labour Front-Bench team believe, is appropriate?",not_statement,
Would it be in line with inflation?,not_statement,
Would it be more than inflation?,not_statement,
How exactly would Labour solve this dispute?,not_statement,
"Angela Rayner I will just educate the hon<prd> Gentleman: although I used to be a trade union official and I am a member of a trade union, I do not negotiate on behalf of a trade union.",not_statement,
But what I would do is sit around the table and resolve this dispute with the trade unions.,not_statement,
That would be better than what the Conservatives have done.,not_statement,
I come to the liability this Bill places upon trade unions.,not_statement,
"It says that trade unions must take “reasonable steps” to ensure workers comply with work notices, but what would they be?",not_statement,
Will trade unions be liable for non-union staff?,not_statement,
"As for the burden put on employers, have they welcomed the bureaucratic nightmare that they will face?",not_statement,
"How will our already overstretched public services spare the resources to work out how many workers are needed to meet the minimum service levels the Secretary of State arbitrarily imposes on them, and to identify which workers should come into work and which should not?",not_statement,
What will these bodies have to do?,not_statement,
Will they have to do this before each and every strike day?,not_statement,
"Paul Holmes (Eastleigh) (Con) I would like to try again on this, because the right hon<prd> Lady aspires to be Deputy Prime Minister and wants to negotiate with the unions in future.",not_statement,
"Will she outline for the House, because the Labour party has been very quiet on this, whether she backs a 19% pay increase for nurses?",not_statement,
What costing has her party put forward as to how much she would award in pay rises to those public sector workers?,not_statement,
Angela Rayner What I can say is that the Labour party would not have crashed the economy like the Conservatives did.,not_statement,
We would not have inflation at the record levels we have at the moment.,not_statement,
We would not have the disputes we have at the moment because we would negotiate with the trade unions and find a settlement.,not_statement,
What protections are in place to prevent unscrupulous employers from targeting trade union members with work notices?,not_statement,
Or is this legislation a licence for blacklisting?,not_statement,
The Secretary of State is hiding behind warped misunderstandings of the International Labour Organisation’s statute book and misleading comparisons with Europe.,not_statement,
The ILO says that minimum service levels can happen only when the  “safety of individuals or their health is at stake”.,not_statement,
Can he explain how that relates to the list of sectors in the Bill?,not_statement,
"Countries such as France and Spain may have minimum service levels, but they have not averted strikes there; both lose far more days to strike action than the UK.",not_statement,
This Bill is a mess.,not_statement,
It makes no sense.,not_statement,
"It has more holes in it than the last Chancellor’s Budget, yet we are being given next to no time to scrutinise it.",not_statement,
"This legislation hands far-reaching powers to the Secretary of State to not just impose minimum service levels, but decide what those levels would be.",not_statement,
The legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg has called clause 3  “a supercharged Henry VIII clause.,not_statement,
”  Where is the consultation the Secretary of State promised?,not_statement,
Where is the impact assessment?,not_statement,
"The Regulatory Policy Committee says, in a scornful statement today, that it has not even received it yet.",not_statement,
So why have the Government given only five hours for debate on the Floor of the House?,not_statement,
"Let us look at what this Bill is really all about: a Government who are out of ideas, out of time and fast running out of sticking plasters; a Government who are playing politics with nurses’ lives because they cannot stomach negotiation; a Government desperately doing all they can to distract from the economic emergency they have caused.",not_statement,
"We have had 13 years of failure, and working people of this country cannot take any more.",not_statement,
What this whole sorry episode makes clear is that this country needs a Labour Government.,not_statement,
"The Conservative party has proven itself incapable of cleaning up its own mess, and the disruption of the past few months simply would not be happening under Labour.",not_statement,
"Neale Hanvey (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) (Alba) It is difficult to listen to the Secretary of State accuse workers who have devoted their lives to life saving, whether they are fire workers, doctors or nurses, of putting others at risk.",not_statement,
"As for the arguments that this is too expensive or too difficult, today Oxfam announced that $21 trillion went into the pockets of 1% internationally during the global pandemic.",not_statement,
Does the right hon<prd> Lady agree that there is enough money but it is just in the wrong pockets?,not_statement,
Angela Rayner The hon<prd> Gentleman makes some important and valid points.,not_statement,
"In the past 12 months to two and a half years, we have seen the unravelling of the VIP fast-track lane for people linked to the Conservative party—that was a waste of billions of pounds that could have gone into investment in our public services.",not_statement,
The public have seen 13 years of Conservative failure.,not_statement,
Most of the public who are watching this debate today can ask themselves one question: do they feel better off after 13 years of the Conservatives?,not_statement,
"The answer to that question is no, unless of course they are in that 1%, with a WhatsApp number of a Government Minister.",not_statement,
"Labour would have resolved these disputes a long time ago, by getting back around the negotiating table in good faith and doing a deal.",not_statement,
"Geraint Davies (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op) Is my right hon<prd> Friend aware that the Labour Government in Wales were given more than £1 billion for personal protective equipment and test, track and trace, and spent only £500 million?",not_statement,
"If we had had that level of savings, instead of having Tory crony donors putting their hand in the till, it would have aggregated up to a saving of £11 billion, as against a total pay cost to the NHS of £56 billion?",not_statement,
"In other words, we are talking about 20% of the annual pay for all nurses and all health workers.",not_statement,
"So does she not agree that if we had a Labour Government, we would have more money to provide decent wages for those in our health service?",not_statement,
"Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my hon<prd> Friend; not only would we have grown the economy—and we have a plan to grow the economy, unlike the Conservatives —but we would not have wasted billions of pounds and we would not have crashed the economy like the Conservatives did.",not_statement,
This Government are not working and this Bill is unworkable.,not_statement,
The sacking nurses Bill is one of the most indefensible and foolish pieces of legislation to come before this House in modern times.,not_statement,
"We on these Benches will vote against this shoddy, unworkable Bill, and I urge every Member across this House who cares for fundamental British freedoms, and who knows that the only way to resolve disputes is by negotiating in good faith, to join us in standing against it this evening.",not_statement,
18:29:00  Priti Patel (Witham) (Con) It is a pleasure to follow the right hon<prd> Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner).,not_statement,
"It was somewhat inevitable that this debate would quickly become partisan, and she reinforced that.",not_statement,
I pay tribute to our hard-working frontline public sector workers.,not_statement,
"On Friday, I visited workers at the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, who have not been on strike, and all credit to them.",not_statement,
"In the operational control centres, people have been working diligently, day in, day out, to manage, quite frankly, the many, many challenging cases.",not_statement,
"This House will understand my particular interest in operational frontline workers, especially when it comes to the police, who cannot strike, and also fire and rescue workers and Border Force officers.",not_statement,
"Just last year, I was able to use existing Home Office budgets to provide the police with a pay increase.",not_statement,
It was a 5% pay increase across the board and one of the largest settlements in the public sector.,not_statement,
"I accepted the recommendation from the Police Remuneration Review Body, and it was my right hon<prd> Friend the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse), who is in his place, who oversaw that settlement.",not_statement,
That funding was vital because we on the Conservative Benches believe in our frontline public sector workers.,not_statement,
"We believe in giving them the resources that they need and the working conditions in which they can do their jobs, but within the affordability of the Government’s financial envelope, which is incredibly important.",not_statement,
Janet Daby (Lewisham East) (Lab) Is the right hon<prd> Lady aware that the Secretary of State’s own colleagues—the Secretaries of State for Transport and for Education—believe that the Bill will not solve the strikes?,not_statement,
"Priti Patel I say to the hon<prd> Lady and to all Members in the House that we are facing fundamental economic challenges right now, and they have to be met within the financial envelope of this Government.",not_statement,
That is a statement of the obvious.,not_statement,
We have seen that on our borders; border control is being weakened by strikes.,not_statement,
Patients and those in need of essential medical care are facing disruption.,not_statement,
That is not right.,not_statement,
All of us have constituents.,not_statement,
"This is not about one constituency against another, or one part of the country against the other.",not_statement,
We have seen commuters who cannot get to work.,not_statement,
That is wrong.,not_statement,
"Again, that is not right.",not_statement,
I know that many workers—I think that we all know this—find the decision to go out on strike very difficult.,not_statement,
They struggle when it comes to voting in ballots because of the options that are sometimes put in front of them.,not_statement,
"We also know that there are some in the trade union movement—we must recognise this and we have heard it already from those on the Opposition Benches—who are happy to go along with the disruption, which is not acceptable.",not_statement,
Some get satisfaction out of this.,not_statement,
I am afraid that we have seen that in the past.,not_statement,
We have seen Opposition Members go on picket lines and cheer and make political points.,not_statement,
"That is not right, because, at the end of the day, it is the public who suffer.",not_statement,
"Indeed, since 2010, we have seen the hard left and militants take action and co-ordinate strikes, and the public suffer.",not_statement,
That is not right.,not_statement,
"Let us not forget that it was the Conservatives who, in the 1980s, stood up to the militant trade unions, and, importantly, introduced reforms.",not_statement,
Priti Patel I do not have time to give way.,not_statement,
"Priti Patel I cannot give way, because I do not have time.",not_statement,
Mr Deputy Speaker (Sir Roger Gale) I call the SNP spokesperson.,not_statement,
18:35:00  Alan Brown (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (SNP) The right hon<prd> Member for Witham (Priti Patel) said that this was a partisan debate.,not_statement,
"Of course it is a partisan debate, because we either believe in the right of workers to strike or we do not, so, clearly, it is a partisan debate.",not_statement,
She spoke about SMEs struggling because of strikes.,not_statement,
I can tell her that SMEs in my constituency are more worried about their energy bills going through the roof and the lack of Government support that is coming down the line from April onwards.,not_statement,
"We know that this is “anti-strike legislation”—those are not my words, but the words of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from the Dispatch Box last week at Scotland questions.",not_statement,
He boasted that his Government were introducing “anti-strike” legislation in a rare bit of honesty from the Dispatch Box.,not_statement,
"The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy keeps going on about minimum ambulance cover, but the reality is that this is an attack on millions of public sector workers.",not_statement,
The explanatory notes tell us that this is a Tory manifesto commitment about tackling transport strikes.,not_statement,
"Although the Conservatives might hide behind that manifesto commitment, that commitment has nothing to do with clamping down on the NHS or on teachers.",not_statement,
"The Conservatives claim that it is about safety, but, as I said earlier, the word “safety” is not used once in the Bill or in explanatory notes.",not_statement,
"The reality is that this is an ideological war on the unions, which the Tories somehow think will curry favour with the public.",not_statement,
It is a misty-eyed look back to Margaret Thatcher taking on the National Union of Mineworkers.,not_statement,
"It was a battle that she won, but it was a battle that resulted in the closures of mines and left communities devasted and thousands of workers on the dole.",not_statement,
Do we really want to go back to sacking workers and putting them on the dole?,not_statement,
That is what this is all about.,not_statement,
"We know that this is an ideological war, because, in this period of Tory governance, the Government have already given us the Trade Union Act 2016, introducing voting thresholds, and then, last year, the legislation to allow employers to hire agency staff to break strikes.",not_statement,
"There is no doubt that this Government want to end strikes, effectively removing the ultimate backstop on collective bargaining.",not_statement,
"The Bill not only facilitates an attack on workers, but enables employers to potentially sue unions for damages.",not_statement,
"It is no wonder that it is opposed by the TUC, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Unison, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing among others, and I certainly support them in opposing this.",not_statement,
"Neither the Scottish Government nor the Welsh Government want this legislation, but, yet again, this legislation will be imposed on the devolved nations.",not_statement,
"In Scotland, this is further proof that the Westminster straitjacket does us no good at all.",not_statement,
"We could have had employment and workers’ rights devolved, but, unfortunately, Labour resisted those powers coming to Scotland.",not_statement,
"However, even the STUC has now called for the devolution of employment rights to Scotland, so perhaps Labour should consider that, instead of listening to Gordon Brown’s rehash of broken promises.",not_statement,
"It is worth noting that the Bill does not impact Northern Ireland, as employment law is already devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, so, yet again, the so-called most powerful devolved Parliament in the world—the Scottish Parliament—has fewer powers than the Northern Ireland Assembly, and this proves it.",not_statement,
"This ideological attack comes from someone who, as Transport Secretary, was non-existent when it came to dialogue and communications, and that was confirmed by the unions.",not_statement,
"He was somebody who was blocking the DFT from agreeing deals, and now we have that same person in post leading the charge for anti-strike and anti-worker legislation.",not_statement,
"Given the Secretary of State’s form, we know that he is up for a fight, but even if wins this fight, he will be destroying worker relationships for good.",not_statement,
"These are hard-pressed workers, particularly from within the NHS, who are struggling at times with the pressures that they are under.",not_statement,
Who seriously thinks that not negotiating and threatening workers with the sack for striking will help matters?,not_statement,
It is utterly insane.,not_statement,
"As the rail unions pointed out at the Transport Committee last week, deals have been agreed where DfT and UK Ministers are not involved.",not_statement,
"Clearly the union asks cannot be too unreasonable, when RMT and ASLEF have agreed deals with ScotRail and the Scottish Government, deals in Wales and deals with Merseyrail, for example—deals with Governments and authorities that have been hamstrung by the Tory austerity imposed on them, yet still managed to agree deals.",not_statement,
The Tories tell us they are the party of workers.,not_statement,
"That phrase fools no one, but they also tell us they are all about a high-wage, skilled economy.",not_statement,
"Yet, as we have heard, when workers ask for a wage rise they are told no, that it is unaffordable; even worse, in the case of the rail unions, the Secretary of State quotes figures that he thinks show how well paid all rail staff are.",not_statement,
"That is really telling: the Secretary of State is effectively saying, “Train drivers are overpaid—how dare they ask for a wage rise?",not_statement,
”.,not_statement,
That is insulting beyond belief.,not_statement,
The Tories can forget saying they want a high-wage economy.,not_statement,
They were quite happy for the rail companies to pay dividends during the pandemic.,not_statement,
"They were quite happy for Virgin Trains East Coast to walk away from the London North Eastern Railway franchise owing billions of pounds, but they always go for attacking workers.",not_statement,
It is the same with the Secretary’s rhetoric about this legislation mirroring what happens elsewhere in Europe.,not_statement,
His soundbites are easily proven to be false.,not_statement,
"Indeed, the general secretary of the European Federation of Public Service Unions, Jan Willem Goudriaan, argued that comparison by the UK Government of this Bill with existing laws in other EU countries was misrepresenting the situation, because all minimum service levels in Europe are agreed through negotiation.",not_statement,
"Moreover, the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, Esther Lynch, said:  “The UK already has among the most draconian restrictions on the right to strike in Europe, and the UK government’s plans would push it even further away from normal, democratic practice across Europe”.",not_statement,
"Pablo Sánchez Centellas, a spokesperson for the EPSU, was much more succinct, saying, “It’s bollocks.",not_statement,
” The Secretary of State should reflect on the true position of this proposed legislation compared with what is happening in Europe.,not_statement,
"He has also rightly pointed out that the human rights memorandum that accompanied the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill set out reasons why minimum service levels were not justified in fire services, health settings or education, yet that is what the Government now propose.",not_statement,
"By default, this Government are now going against their own previous human rights opinion.",not_statement,
What kind of madness is that?,not_statement,
"When it comes to the International Labour Organisation, which the Secretary of State likes to reference, its idea of minimum service requirements is clearly intended to be based on endangerment to life, personal safety or health.",not_statement,
This wide-ranging legislation goes way beyond those parameters.,not_statement,
"The ILO makes it clear there should be an independent arbitration body, yet this Bill is completely silent on such a body.",not_statement,
Why is that?,not_statement,
It is also clear that any minimum service level is supposed to be just that—a bare minimum.,not_statement,
We have no idea what this Government will railroad through via statutory instruments.,not_statement,
"Statutory instruments cannot be amended and the last time a Government was defeated on a statutory instrument was in 1979, so we know all power rests with the Government there.",not_statement,
"As Liberty has observed, the Bill does not create any form of minimal service.",not_statement,
"Liberty also confirms that MPs debating this legislation on Second Reading will not know exactly what they are voting for, so all the Tory MPs in the Chamber who are going to take part in the debate and then trot through the Lobby will do so blind to what the future legislation and regulations on minimum service will look like.",not_statement,
It is an affront to democracy.,not_statement,
Any Tory MP who claims to care about parliamentary sovereignty cannot possibly vote for this Bill.,not_statement,
The Bill is made worse by the Henry VIII power that allows amendment and revocation even of future legislation not yet passed.,not_statement,
We can see how the Government are ramming this Bill through Parliament with minimum scrutiny and a proposed programme motion allowing just five hours for Committee.,not_statement,
It really is an assault on democracy.,not_statement,
"The fact that the Bill comes into effect immediately once passed, so that work notices and actions can be taken by employers for strikes that have already been voted through, shows just how ridiculous this assault on workers is.",not_statement,
"The impact assessment for the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill observes that on a strike day in July 2022, 20% of rail services were still in operation.",not_statement,
Right away that suggests to me that a minimum level of service was operating.,not_statement,
"What do the Tories really think a minimum service is, if 20% is not a bare minimum?",not_statement,
"There are huge ramifications here for rail workers overall, because if this Government force through a high threshold of minimum service, strikes by signalmen and track operatives will effectively be banned.",not_statement,
"A high minimum service will force all those guys to work to keep the tracks in operation and the trains running, effectively blocking strikes by the back door.",not_statement,
What will minimum service look like for teachers?,not_statement,
Where does that fit in with all the talk about safety?,not_statement,
"What happens to train companies that cannot provide a minimum service at the moment, especially if union members decide not to work on their rest days and to work to rule?",not_statement,
Where will that leave this Government on minimum service level obligations?,not_statement,
The overview in the explanatory notes makes it clear that the ability to sack workers is a key aspect of the Bill.,not_statement,
"That is the polar opposite of what was said when a transport strike Bill was listed in the Queen’s Speech in December 2019, when it was stated that workers would not be discriminated against.",not_statement,
Why are the Government now threatening people’s livelihoods?,not_statement,
How can that be deemed acceptable?,not_statement,
"The sacking aspect is the proof that this is nothing to do with minimum cover by ambulance staff, as the Secretary of State likes to tell us.",not_statement,
"For fire services, the Secretary of State could also utilise the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, if he felt the desire to do so.",not_statement,
It is crystal clear that this legislation is not required.,not_statement,
"It is an attack on democracy and the right to strike; it will prolong industrial disputes, not resolve them; it will allow individual workers to be targeted through work notices; and it is politically stupid.",not_statement,
We have to wonder why this Tory Government are looking to antagonise something like 7 million workers across these sectors.,not_statement,
The public can see through a Government who partied while clapping the nurses and now threaten them with the sack.,not_statement,
They should follow the lead of the Scottish Government and get around the negotiating table.,not_statement,
The resolution of the ScotRail dispute has been commended by both the RMT and ASLEF.,not_statement,
There are no strikes planned in the health service in Scotland and the pay deal being implemented by the Scottish Government is one that the UK Government should replicate as a starting point when they get around the negotiating table.,not_statement,
"It is outrageous that the Scottish Government, who have been negotiating in good faith with the unions, will now have this legislation foisted upon them—legislation that Westminster could use to force work notices through in Scotland against the wishes of the Scottish Government and that could ruin otherwise good working relationships in Scotland.",not_statement,
"Employment law should be devolved to Scotland, but even that would now just be a sticking plaster.",not_statement,
"It is perfectly obvious that what Scotland now needs is the full powers of a normal, independent country.",not_statement,
Mr Deputy Speaker (Sir Roger Gale) I call the Chair of the Transport Committee.,not_statement,
"18:49:00  Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con) It is a pleasure to contribute to this debate as Chair of the Transport Committee, and I will focus my comments on that particular sector.",not_statement,
Let me say at the outset that I support the objective behind the Bill.,not_statement,
"It does not strike me as unreasonable to seek a mechanism whereby the right of a worker to strike, which I have no quibble with, is balanced against the equally important right of an individual to go about their daily life, to travel to work, for healthcare, for education, to visit loved ones or for any of the millions of other reasons why people travel about.",not_statement,
It is therefore appropriate to find a mechanism by which those two rights can be reconciled.,not_statement,
"There are, however, a number of practical issues that I will put on the record.",not_statement,
I understand that this is framework legislation and that the detail on how it will operate in the transport sector will follow.,not_statement,
I was heartened to hear that the consultation on the rail side of transport will be in place before the Bill completes its parliamentary passage.,not_statement,
There are some issues that have to be clarified and resolved before the Bill can properly take effect.,not_statement,
"As has already been alluded to, it is possible in rail, for example, for parts of the system to operate at a minimum level.",not_statement,
One train an hour could run from London to Manchester instead of three—there are a number of ways to have that reduction in service.,not_statement,
"But some parts of the system are binary: a signal box is either open or closed; and in aviation, an air traffic control centre is either open or closed.",not_statement,
We need clarity on where the minimum level of service will apply.,not_statement,
"A related point is whether every aviation, railway or bus line and service will have a minimum service or just a percentage of overall capacity.",not_statement,
There is a trade-off to be made.,not_statement,
"If another line operates nearby, does that mean that both lines have to operate a minimum service, or would one have a more regular service?",not_statement,
Those are the trade-offs that will have to be made.,not_statement,
"In the current dispute on the railways, Network Rail and the train operating companies have a degree of flexibility in making decisions on which lines and stations will be open.",not_statement,
"Will what they have to cover now be specified in the regulations, or will they be left with some discretion?",not_statement,
Dave Doogan (Angus) (SNP) Will the hon<prd> Member give way?,not_statement,
"Iain Stewart If the hon<prd> Gentleman will forgive me, I have only a minute left and many Members wish to speak.",not_statement,
My last point is about what will be covered by the definition of “transport services”.,not_statement,
"There are the traditional ones that we all assume will be covered—trains, buses, flights, ferries and the like—but what about some of the other modes of transport, such as cycle hire or taxi services?",not_statement,
What does the definition encompass?,not_statement,
"I will ask my Committee, when we meet later this week, if we can usefully contribute to the consultation, but I thought it would be helpful in this part of the debate to set out some of the questions that will have to be addressed as the Bill goes through.",not_statement,
18:53:00  Darren Jones (Bristol North West) (Lab) I declare an interest as a member of Unite the union.,not_statement,
May I start by correcting the public record?,not_statement,
"As always, I am grateful to Ministers for taking the time to speak with me directly about Bills in my capacity as Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.",not_statement,
"Unfortunately, in a Westminster Hall debate on Thursday, the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the hon<prd> Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake), referenced our discussion without giving me advance notice.",not_statement,
He said that I was  “very supportive of a minimum service level”.,not_statement,
"—[Official Report, 12 January 2023; Vol.",not_statement,
"725, c.",not_statement,
372WH.,not_statement,
"]  Let me be very clear to the House, to the Minister and to my constituents: I am against the Bill and will vote against it this evening.",not_statement,
"What I said to the Minister was that I—and, I am sure, many people—think it reasonable for there to be a minimum level of service from our emergency services during a period of strike action, and I encouraged him to pursue that via discussion with the relevant services and trade unions, not by threatening them with the prospect of an effective statutory ban on their right to strike.",not_statement,
"When I asked the Minister whether he had sought to achieve that before introducing the legislation, he was unable to fully answer my question.",not_statement,
"As we have already heard this evening, the rationale for the Bill is therefore in question.",not_statement,
"The Government say that the legislation in place is not effective and that voluntary agreements cannot be sought, but that is not correct.",not_statement,
"Indeed, in signing off the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill and its compliance with the European convention on human rights, even the Government said:  “In the case of other key public services, important factors exist to mitigate the impacts of industrial action”.",not_statement,
So what has changed?,not_statement,
"As we have already heard, section 240 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 makes it a criminal offence and a breach of employment contract to strike if doing so puts someone’s life in danger or puts them at risk of serious injury.",not_statement,
"That is why we have statutory guidance in place across public services, and it is why trade unions put life-and-limb service provision in place when they organise strikes with management.",not_statement,
"On voluntary agreements, in December last year and this month, such agreements have been put in place.",not_statement,
"As far as I am aware—from speaking with striking nurses at Southmead Hospital in my constituency, and later with senior management—there were no problems with those voluntary service arrangements, so the law is in place, voluntary agreements are in place, and there is no rationale for the Bill.",not_statement,
We can therefore only conclude that it is a negotiating tactic—a threat—by the Government.,not_statement,
"Lastly, my Committee was disappointed by the lack of time for scrutinising the Bill.",not_statement,
"Once again, Ministers have introduced primary legislation with wide-ranging discretionary powers for Ministers without publishing the details of vital secondary legislation in a timely manner.",not_statement,
That is unacceptable.,not_statement,
It is poor practice for Ministers to bring legislation to the House in that way.,not_statement,
"As the Regulatory Policy Committee confirmed for me today, the Government are obliged to publish an impact assessment so that that Committee can inform the House of the impact of legislation proposed by Ministers.",not_statement,
"However, Ministers have not given the Regulatory Policy Committee the time to review the Government’s impact assessment and then inform the House about the consequences of the legislation.",not_statement,
"So not only do we have a Bill that has no evidence-based rationale for the need to legislate on voluntary agreements, but we have a Government rushing through the legislation without following due process and without drafting it to the standard that this House requires.",not_statement,
"It is clearly a rushed threat, it is unacceptable and it shows disregard for the House and the job that we have to do as parliamentarians to ensure that the law is passed effectively.",not_statement,
"To summarise, can the Minister confirm that the Government will publish the statutory instruments and the impact assessment before the Bill finishes its passage through this House?",not_statement,
I politely suggest that he may want to have another go at trying to explain to the House why the Bill is even necessary in the first place.,not_statement,
18:57:00  Saqib Bhatti (Meriden) (Con) I stand to speak in favour of the legislation and to commend the Government for taking this difficult but necessary step.,not_statement,
Today I want to talk about duty.,not_statement,
"Through this legislation, we on the Conservative Benches are fulfilling our duty to protect our constituents.",not_statement,
Those on the Labour Benches—in hock to their trade union masters—are failing theirs.,not_statement,
"Nurses, teachers, firefighters and all the other professions covered in the legislation are true heroes in our society.",not_statement,
They carry out a great service to our communities.,not_statement,
"We must continue to focus on growing our economy to meet the wage demands of public sector workers, but we must also maintain the independence of pay review bodies precisely so that we can take the politics out of public sector pay.",not_statement,
The conversation should also be about fairness and balancing the right to strike with the public’s right to be kept safe.,not_statement,
"We saw that with the Royal College of Nursing, which maintained a safe level of service.",not_statement,
"That just goes to show how selfless and professional those nurses where while exercising their democratic right, and I am grateful to them for protecting the public.",not_statement,
"I certainly hope that, in the next independent pay review, we reach a positive result and avoid future strike action.",not_statement,
The concept of minimum service levels is protected in article 11 of the ECHR and is endorsed by the International Labour Organisation.,not_statement,
"As we have already heard, this is no different from what is done in Italy, France and Spain.",not_statement,
"In that light, I find the position of the Labour party quite astonishing.",not_statement,
We all have a primary duty to protect our constituents and our communities.,not_statement,
"By opposing the legislation, the Labour party is, in my view, failing in that duty.",not_statement,
"To be frank, Labour has supported the strikes, whether implicitly or explicitly.",not_statement,
"At best, it has failed to take an appropriate stand against the trade unions; at worst, it is egging them on and relishing the disruption and division being caused.",not_statement,
"Is that what the modern Labour party stands for—closing down our schools, bringing our country to a standstill and threatening livelihoods?",not_statement,
"I know it is a new year, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is the same old Labour party.",not_statement,
We on the Government Benches will not compromise on our fundamental duty.,not_statement,
"We will do all we can to protect our constituents, our communities and our society.",not_statement,
That is why I endorse the Bill.,not_statement,
19:00:00  Kate Osborne (Jarrow) (Lab) I direct the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests: I am a proud trade union member.,not_statement,
Each of those power grabs commits political violence on our communities.,not_statement,
Chris Loder (West Dorset) (Con) Will the hon<prd> Member give way?,not_statement,
Kate Osborne No.,not_statement,
This Government are turning back the clock not just on workers’ rights but on the rights of the vast majority of this country.,not_statement,
"As always, Ministers are only concerned about making money for their cronies and big business.",not_statement,
My constituents have been in touch with me over the last few days to express how angry and disappointed they are at the Government’s handling of these disputes.,not_statement,
"While I have time, I would rather say what my constituents want me to say than hear what Conservative Members want to say.",not_statement,
"My constituent Robert Best from Boldon emailed me yesterday:  “The Government should be finding ways to help striking workers, rather than remove their right to strike!",not_statement,
"Right now, refusing to negotiate with workers is the last thing our country needs.",not_statement,
"”  Robert is, of course, completely correct.",not_statement,
"Workers need a pay rise, not a P45.",not_statement,
"Last week, in a question to the Business Secretary, I referenced the struggles of the Tolpuddle martyrs and the seven men of Jarrow—people who were criminalised 200 years ago for fighting for basic health and safety and pay.",not_statement,
The response I got was that I should stop “raving on”.,not_statement,
I will not stop raving on.,not_statement,
I will not stop supporting workers and the people in my community.,not_statement,
"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Kevin Hollinrake) I am grateful to the hon<prd> Member for giving way.",not_statement,
Will she point out where there are any criminal sanctions attached to the proposed legislation?,not_statement,
"As far as I can see, there are absolutely none.",not_statement,
It is important that we do not scaremonger in that way.,not_statement,
Kate Osborne The Government’s proposed legislation and the response I just got show the contempt in which they hold working people.,not_statement,
The Government do not care about working people.,not_statement,
"They do not care about our communities who are struggling to survive in the face of unaffordable food and energy bills, and struggling to deal with the cost of living crisis and 13 years of cuts by the Conservative party.",not_statement,
"We already have the most restrictive workers’ rights in western Europe, and it is an affront to democracy that this Government are trying to restrict them further.",not_statement,
"Of course, the Government know that the Bill is not workable.",not_statement,
"It will be held up in the other place, if it gets that far, and in the courts.",not_statement,
They only care about attention-grabbing headlines—about moving the Overton window so the people of this country will accept more and more restrictions on their rights.,not_statement,
"Minimum service levels already exist: our NHS teams ensure that priority calls are dealt with, and teachers ensure that special educational needs children are catered for.",not_statement,
What we need is for the Government to provide a minimum service level every day.,not_statement,
We hear daily of workers struggling to cope with current staffing levels.,not_statement,
"The Government should be looking at ways to address the NHS staffing crisis, not making it worse.",not_statement,
"The Government need to accept that the reason so many sectors are saying “enough is enough” and taking industrial action—we heard the announcement today that the teaching unions will take action, and I send my solidarity to them—is the Government’s failures.",not_statement,
"The firefighters, NHS staff, transport staff and education staff that the Bill targets are the very people who saw us through the pandemic.",not_statement,
"If the Bill passes, no doubt the Government will eventually seek to apply the legislation to workers in more sectors.",not_statement,
"Instead of inflaming the situation, they should start dealing with the causes of increased strike action: low wages, fuel and food poverty, and cuts to public services.",not_statement,
"As I said at the start, it is an act of political violence.",not_statement,
The Government should do the right thing for the country and withdraw it.,not_statement,
"19:05:00  Dr Ben Spencer (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con) We have had so much disruption to our critical services in recent years, and I pay tribute to all those working in those sectors.",not_statement,
I support minimum service levels for our critical services.,not_statement,
Who could oppose them?,not_statement,
"Well, the Labour party does.",not_statement,
"It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but does that not ignore the rights of all of those who rely on these key services for their health, their education and their livelihood?",not_statement,
"We have seen the sad impact on pupils of disruption to education, the extra burden it places on families and schools, and the anxiety that causes parents and students.",not_statement,
The Children’s Commissioner highlighted this weekend that it is the most disadvantaged who face the greatest impact if education is disrupted.,not_statement,
"I support the right of children to a great education, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.",not_statement,
"It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but that ignores the rights of working families and students if schools close.",not_statement,
Minimum service levels should also apply to our ambulance service.,not_statement,
"We all know the challenges our NHS is facing, yet at a time when we need to focus on addressing them, Labour opposes minimum service levels for our ambulance and fire services.",not_statement,
Does anyone really believe it should be up to intransigent unions to decide whether help arrives?,not_statement,
Emergency services should not be a bargaining chip in employment disputes.,not_statement,
Our country cannot be held to ransom by intransigent unions.,not_statement,
"I believe the NHS should be there when we need it, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.",not_statement,
"It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but what about the right to receive care in an emergency?",not_statement,
The rail strikes are yet another example.,not_statement,
"I have been contacted by constituents whose children are unable to get to school, commuters unable to get to work, and patients unable to see their loved ones in hospital or go to appointments.",not_statement,
"I support everyone’s right to travel, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.",not_statement,
"It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but what about the rights of the self-employed?",not_statement,
Are they not workers?,not_statement,
What about the rights of small business employees?,not_statement,
Are they not workers?,not_statement,
What about the rights of drivers?,not_statement,
Are they not workers?,not_statement,
"What about cleaners, administrators or carers—or any worker in a sector not supported by unions?",not_statement,
"I was elected to this House to represent all my constituents, and that means protecting health services, education and livelihoods.",not_statement,
"In the light of union intransience to negotiate and modernise, minimum service levels are now needed, so I wholeheartedly support the Bill.",not_statement,
I am genuinely appalled that the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.,not_statement,
It says it is protecting workers’ rights.,not_statement,
I think we all know who it is really protecting.,not_statement,
"19:08:00  Vicky Foxcroft (Lewisham, Deptford) (Lab) Let me start by declaring an interest: I am a proud member of both Unite the union and GMB and, prior to being elected to this place, I worked for Unite the union for over a decade.",not_statement,
"Contrary to what some Conservative Members may have us believe, trade unions want their workplaces to thrive.",not_statement,
"They know that a productive workplace needs a happy, motivated workforce.",not_statement,
"They know that, when companies make large profits, they can ask for decent pay rises for their members.",not_statement,
"When workplaces struggle, they will work with the employer to ensure it survives.",not_statement,
We all know how public sector workers kept our country moving during the pandemic.,not_statement,
"They worked night and day to keep us safe, but how does this Government seek to repay them?",not_statement,
"First, with a derisory pay offer and then— because the unions have voted to strike, rather than roll over and accept the derisory pay offer—the Prime Minister has resorted to launching a fundamental attack on workers’ freedoms.",not_statement,
This Bill is unworkable and impractical.,not_statement,
"Between 2010 and 2020, France lost almost six times as many days to strikes as the UK, and Spain lost more than twice as many.",not_statement,
"Ironically, we already have minimum service levels in place in the UK.",not_statement,
"I remember when I joined a picket line with striking firemen and women, and they told me how they had agreed with their employer that, if there was any fire or any other emergency, they would jump into the fire engines and be straight there.",not_statement,
"None of them wanted to see anyone lose their lives because of their action, which was their last resort.",not_statement,
"Most worryingly, the Bill does not give any indication of what will constitute a minimum level of service, meaning that the Secretary of State will be able to change that at their discretion.",not_statement,
"Having stretched public services and the workforce to breaking point, the Government’s solution is to create conditions in which workers can be forced into work and are unable to withhold their labour, no matter what the employee does.",not_statement,
Is that really the kind of Britain of which we want to be part—one in which workers’ freedoms are being restricted to the extent that they could be sacked for standing up for their rights?,not_statement,
Chris Loder What would the hon<prd> Lady say to those members of the RMT who decided to come back to work before Christmas because they did not agree with what the union was doing?,not_statement,
Vicky Foxcroft That is democracy.,not_statement,
Trade unions are subject to the most vigorous legislation when they are balloting and trade union money is the cleanest money in politics.,not_statement,
"Public sector workers are proud of the role they play in society, saving and protecting lives, but they need to be valued and their voices matter.",not_statement,
"When our NHS workers say they are worried about public health and the NHS, we need to listen, not curtail the right for their voices to be heard.",not_statement,
The Government could and should have negotiated with the trade unions to get a decent settlement.,not_statement,
They need to listen closely to the concerns that workers across the country have been raising.,not_statement,
"I thoroughly believe that, when we work together, we achieve better outcomes.",not_statement,
I defend their right to strike and I will be voting against this Bill.,not_statement,
"19:13:00  Laura Farris (Newbury) (Con) I would like to accept the invitation of the shadow Deputy Prime Minister, the right hon<prd> Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner), who encouraged us to be respectful in this debate.",not_statement,
I wish to be so.,not_statement,
"We have heard a lot from the Labour party this evening about how the Bill is an act of political violence and an attack on the fundamental freedom of working people, but we have not heard an answer to the fundamental question that the legislation poses: do the British people have a right set out in statute to a basic safety and security guarantee during periods of strike?",not_statement,
Let us start with the law.,not_statement,
"Joanna Cherry The hon<prd> Lady asks whether any of us on the Opposition Benches care about fundamental safety levels, and yes we do.",not_statement,
"She asked whether we would support legislating, but legislation already exists.",not_statement,
"On article 11, she knows as well as I do that the measures have to be “necessary”.",not_statement,
"The Government’s own memo with the last legislation said that the measures were not necessary in relation to the health service, education and fire and rescue.",not_statement,
"Laura Farris I thank the hon<prd> and learned Lady for her point, and I will assist her, because I was coming on to that point.",not_statement,
"The article 11 right may be restricted for two reasons—if the restriction is necessary, yes, and proportionate.",not_statement,
"The International Labour Organisation, of which the United Kingdom is a founding member, recognises that maintaining a minimum level of service provision can be both when it comes to essential services.",not_statement,
"Its committee on freedom of association has expressly set out the two circumstances in which it may be appropriate: where strike action would pose a risk to life, safety or health; or where the service is not essential in the strict sense of the word, but where repeated strikes would bring a very important sector to a standstill.",not_statement,
"Chris Stephens The ILO also says, does it not, that the minimum service level has to be agreed by an independent arbiter if there is a dispute, which is not in the Bill, and that there should not be a dismissal, which is in the Bill?",not_statement,
Laura Farris I am grateful to both SNP Members for their interventions.,not_statement,
"I am coming on to those points, so I will make a tiny bit of progress, if I may.",not_statement,
"On the point raised by the hon<prd> and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry), we already know that transport and education meet the ILO’s test, because the ILO told the United Kingdom that in its response to the challenge to the Trade Union Act 2016 submitted by the TUC in 2015.",not_statement,
"In its response, the ILO committee of experts—Members can look it up; it is on the website—said that in relation to transport and education  “recourse might be had to negotiated minimum standards for these sectors as appropriate”.",not_statement,
We also know that many comparable countries take a much tougher line than the Government are proposing.,not_statement,
"In the United States, to give one example, 38 out of 50 states ban public sector strikes altogether.",not_statement,
"Barry Gardiner (Brent North) (Lab) The hon<prd> Lady is presenting a reasoned case, but she knows, and she has just used the word, that these things should be negotiated.",not_statement,
The measures in this Bill are by fiat of the Secretary of State.,not_statement,
Laura Farris I thank the hon<prd> Gentleman for his point.,not_statement,
"I am coming to all these things, so if he will give me a moment, I will continue.",not_statement,
"In the United States, 38 out of 50 states have an outright ban on public sector strikes, including New York.",not_statement,
"Other states, such as Canada, Australia, Italy and Spain, all have embedded in statute minimum service levels that apply to important public services, and those services are often drawn much more widely than the Government are proposing.",not_statement,
"They include waste collection, postal services, broadcast services, the administration of justice, water distribution and energy supply.",not_statement,
"I pick out those states not as random examples, but because every single one is a member of the International Labour Organisation.",not_statement,
"They are bound by exactly the same rules as us, and they are among our closest comparators around the world.",not_statement,
"Even more importantly, the International Labour Organisation has adjudicated all their statutory minimum service levels, and a 2019 publication from the ILO in Geneva commented:  “These examples illustrate the wide diversity of approach that ILO member states have adopted to address the challenges posed by industrial disputes in essential services”.",not_statement,
"Minimum service levels  “supported by the ILO’s supervisory organs, exist to manage the balancing act between these necessary restrictions and the individual worker’s fundamental labour rights”.",not_statement,
I have not heard a single Member of Parliament tonight explain to me why the ILO is wrong or why the Government are striking the wrong balance when they have a mandate for what they are doing.,not_statement,
"Sam Tarry (Ilford South) (Lab) For example, the ILO imposes restraints on the circumstances in which such powers can be used, which is the antithesis of the Government’s blank cheque approach.",not_statement,
"Laura Farris With respect to the hon<prd> Gentleman, I take the opposite position.",not_statement,
The United States has an outright ban on public service strikes in 38 states.,not_statement,
"In December, President Biden made his most recent intervention in union rights when he signed legislation that imposed an outright ban on a national railroad strike.",not_statement,
"The United States is a founder member, as we are, of the International Labour Organisation.",not_statement,
"It goes much further, but the ILO has found its ban to be lawful.",not_statement,

"In the short time that I have, I will talk about the Bill.",not_statement,
"It is dishonest; it is an insult to trade unions, which are the aspirational vehicle of the working class; and it is an insult to Parliament and parliamentary procedures.",not_statement,
Most of the detail of the Bill is missing and the Government have said that they will add it later—that is not how we are supposed to do politics or make legislation.,not_statement,
"It allows the Government to amend and revoke any future legislation passed in this Session, so what is the point of Parliament?",not_statement,

These strikes are not a new or recent development.,not_statement,
"There have been constant strikes for more than six months among some groups and, in some locations, they have actually been going on for years.",not_statement,

"We have made great efforts to listen to the range of views from businesses, trade unions, representative organisations, civil society and others.",not_statement,
"The insights gained have been invaluable in informing the amendments to ensure the Bill works in practice, both for workers and for businesses of all sizes across the whole country.",not_statement,
"The amendments will strengthen the Bill, providing further detail and clarity on measures and ensuring such measures can be implemented in a straightforward way.",not_statement,
I turn to the detail of the amendments.,not_statement,
What is the answer?,not_statement,
"Justin Madders The answer is in the Department’s press release, which cites Simon Deakin, professor of law at the University of Cambridge, no less.",not_statement,
He has said:  I am sure that the right hon<prd> Member wants to see that happen.,not_statement,
"Liam Byrne (Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North) (Lab) The Minister will have seen the appalling evidence that the Business and Trade Committee took from McDonald’s, where the BBC investigation exposed allegations from hundreds of young workers who were suffering harassment, and even allegations from one worker of managers soliciting them for sex in return for scheduling shifts.",not_statement,
Justin Madders I thank the Chairman of the Select Committee for his question.,not_statement,
"We are aiming to work on this once the Bill has passed this stage, and consultation will take place in due course.",not_statement,
I have to say that the chuntering from those on the Conservative Benches really shows how they fail to appreciate the power imbalance that there is in some workplaces and the exploitation and harassment that arise from that.,not_statement,
"Many agency workers have a preference for guaranteed hours, according to survey evidence.",not_statement,
"We know that 55% of agency workers requested a permanent contract with their hirer between January 2019 and September 2020, according to the Department for Business and Trade’s agency worker survey.",not_statement,
"Given the important role that agency work plays in businesses and public services, we recognise the need to work with the recruitment sector, employers and trade unions to design detailed provisions for regulations that work—that is,  The Government have also tabled amendments in relation to dismissal and redundancy practices.",not_statement,
"Sir Ashley Fox (Bridgwater) (Con) I had the good fortune to serve with the Minister for 21 sessions in Committee, and at the end of that we had a Bill 192 pages long.",not_statement,
"We now have 270 pages of amendments, most of which come from the Government.",not_statement,
Why are they tabling so many amendments and giving them just two days’ scrutiny?,not_statement,
Are these just more union demands?,not_statement,
Justin Madders I have literally just explained how we have been consulting with businesses and trade unions and put down amendments as a result.,not_statement,
"Of course, if the hon<prd> Member is concerned about the length of the amendment paper, he can withdraw his own amendment, which we will no doubt be debating later on.",not_statement,
"We are tabling some technical amendments to clause 21 on unfair dismissal that will update cross-references in other legislation to “the sum”, which is the existing cap on the compensation that can be awarded by an employment tribunal in most unfair dismissal cases.",not_statement,
"13:45:00 We have listened to feedback from business on the clause as introduced, which required consultation whenever 20 or more redundancies were proposed to be made across an employer’s organisation.",not_statement,
"Businesses told us that this would have put them in a constant state of consultation, The amendment means that collective redundancy obligations will be triggered where 20 or more redundancies are proposed at one establishment, in line with the existing law, or the number of proposed redundancies across the organisation meets a certain threshold.",not_statement,
The Government will set this threshold out in due course via secondary legislation.,not_statement,
"This could be a proportion of employees in a business, a suitable number of employees across a business, or some other threshold proposed through detailed consultation.",not_statement,
Employers will also be required to notify the Government of redundancies that meet the threshold set in secondary legislation.,not_statement,
New clause 34 will therefore double the protective award an employment tribunal can make from 90 to 180 days.,not_statement,
"We consulted on this and other matters from October to December 2024, and after listening carefully to a range of responses from businesses and employee representatives, we have concluded that the maximum period of the protective award an employment tribunal can make should be raised from 90 to 180 days.",not_statement,
This is on top of changes that the Government have already made.,not_statement,
"From 20 January this year, employment tribunals have had the ability to uplift the protective award by up to 25% where an employer unreasonably failed to follow the code of practice on dismissal and re-engagement.",not_statement,
We recognise that responsible employers up and down the country already go further than their current obligations to collectively consult and will continue to do so.,not_statement,
The Government are also tabling amendments in relation to the Bill’s provisions on flexible working and dismissal during pregnancy.,not_statement,
Clause 22 adds a new power to make provisions for non-redundancy dismissals during or after the protected period of pregnancy.,not_statement,
The amendments will add supplementary provisions to this power.,not_statement,
We will work with stakeholders on how to exercise these powers in regulations.,not_statement,
Amendment 79 to clause 7 proposes that the flexible working measures in the Bill be added to those provisions in scope of section 202 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.,not_statement,
"That means that the security services—MI5, GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service—will be exempt from disclosing any information related to flexible working requests if, in the opinion of a Minister, it would be contrary to national security.",not_statement,
"In those instances, the employer would not need to disclose the reasons for refusing a request.",not_statement,
The Government are moving amendments on statutory sick pay.,not_statement,
"We launched a public consultation that asked employers, employees, trade unions, stakeholders and members of the public what percentage rate that should be.",not_statement,
Today’s amendments will set the rate of statutory sick pay at 80% of an employee’s normal weekly earnings or the flat rate—whichever is lower.,not_statement,
"Consequently, we will remove the previously proposed power for the Secretary of State to prescribe the percentage rate in secondary legislation.",not_statement,
"However, Ministers will still be able to use the existing power in section 157 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to substitute a different provision as to the weekly flat rate of SSP, or the percentage rate of the employee’s weekly earnings, depending on which is lower.",not_statement,
"The amendments also amend the weekly flat rate to £118<prd>75, as agreed by Parliament as part of its annual uprating exercise.",not_statement,
The Government are moving amendments that will add two new provisions into part 2 of the Bill.,not_statement,
"Analysis conducted by the Resolution Foundation found that 900,000 workers reported that they had no paid holiday despite that being a day one entitlement.",not_statement,
New clause 35 will create a new duty in the Working Time Regulations 1998 for employers to retain records relating to holiday pay and annual leave for six years.,not_statement,
Sir Alec Shelbrooke (Wetherby and Easingwold) (Con) I apologise if the Minister has moved on a bit; I was just waiting to hear what he said.,not_statement,
Justin Madders I am grateful to the right hon<prd> Member for raising this important point.,not_statement,
"It was touched on in Committee, but there are not any amendments dealing with that specific issue today.",not_statement,
"Returning to holiday pay, where an employer does not keep adequate records, a Fair Work Agency enforcement officer may seek a labour market enforcement undertaking from the employer to ensure future compliance.",not_statement,
"Where the employer refuses to give a labour market enforcement undertaking, or fails to comply with one, the FWA enforcement officer may apply to the appropriate court for a labour market enforcement order.",not_statement,
"Chris Law (Dundee Central) (SNP) I apologise to the Minister because he has moved on, but I want to come back to the new level of statutory sick pay, which is £118<prd>75 or 80% of an employee’s weekly earnings.",not_statement,
"An employee with weekly earnings of £125 would at present get £116<prd>75, but under the new model, they would receive only £100.",not_statement,
Is that correct?,not_statement,
"Justin Madders Yes, but the hon<prd> Member forgets the fact that we are removing the waiting days.",not_statement,
"With the provisions on the lower earnings limit going, 1<prd>3 million people will be accessing statutory sick pay.",not_statement,
"Of course, it is something that we will always continue to review.",not_statement,
"Moving on to umbrella companies, we are aware of non-compliance in this market, where umbrella companies can be responsible for denying employment rights to those who work through them.",not_statement,
"New clause 36 will allow for the regulation of umbrella companies and for enforcement by the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, and subsequently the Fair Work Agency.",not_statement,
"The specific requirements on umbrella companies will be set out in the relevant regulations, which set out the minimum standards of conduct for employment agencies and employment businesses.",not_statement,
"We will consult before amending these regulations, and we are committed to working with the sector to ensure that future regulation works effectively for umbrella companies.",not_statement,
"The Government are moving a range of amendments in relation to part 3 of the Bill, which covers the adult social care negotiating body and the school support staff negotiating body.",not_statement,
"On the SSSNB, the Government are moving two technical amendments to correct incorrect cross-references.",not_statement,
The body is an important part of delivering both the Government’s “Plan to Make Work Pay” and our opportunity mission.,not_statement,
The Government will today commit to consult in the summer on whether agency workers should be brought into scope of the SSSNB in future legislation to support those missions.,not_statement,
"Munira Wilson (Twickenham) (LD) Could the Minister clarify for the House whether the provisions on the school support staff negotiating body will provide a ceiling as well as a floor on pay, or will it just be a floor?",not_statement,
There are certainly a number of school and academy leaders who say they want to pay above what the Government might recommend for support staff and that this may limit them from doing so.,not_statement,
Justin Madders That was debated in detail in Committee.,not_statement,
"My understanding is that there will be a floor, but there will not be a ceiling.",not_statement,
"If I am wrong about that, I will come back to that.",not_statement,
"Amendments to the adult social care negotiating body provisions will remove clause 42, thereby removing the power to make stand-alone enforcement provision in respect of the agreements reached by negotiating body.",not_statement,
Enforcement of pay terms under agreements will instead be in the remit of the new Fair Work Agency under schedule 4.,not_statement,
Wendy Morton (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con) The Minister is rattling off a whole list of amendments that appear to have come after the legislation has gone through Committee.,not_statement,
"Justin Madders The reason why we are putting so many amendments down is because we have been consulting and working with businesses, and that is why we have so much to say today.",not_statement,
"Sir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con) In that consultation, how many small businesses expressed their support for the Bill?",not_statement,
"Justin Madders I refer the right hon<prd> Member to our departmental press release, where at least half a dozen business representatives and businesses have expressed support, and of course, there are many more businesses out there.",not_statement,
"Indeed, I visited one only recently that supported the Bill.",not_statement,
Alison Griffiths (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con) Would the Minister be kind enough to name one of those businesses on the press release?,not_statement,
[Interruption.,not_statement,
] He had better look at the press release just to check.,not_statement,
"Justin Madders There is the Co-op—quite a big business—Richer Sounds, Centrica and the British Chambers of Commerce.",not_statement,
"These are not bit-part players at all, are they?",not_statement,
"New clause 38 seeks to ensure that agency workers in the adult social care sector who do not have a “worker’s contract”, within the meaning of employment legislation, would nevertheless be able to bring a claim in the employment tribunals or in civil proceedings where a fair pay agreement has been breached.",not_statement,
It does that by deeming a contract to exist for this purpose between the worker and the party that pays them.,not_statement,
"New clause 37 and associated amendments will enable the Scottish and Welsh Ministers to establish their own separate negotiating bodies and associated framework, and to enable their negotiating bodies and the resulting agreements to cover social care workers in both adult and children’s social care.",not_statement,
"Care policy, funding and commissioning is delivered together in both Wales and Scotland.",not_statement,
"In England, the two workforces, and therefore the policies and delivery, are distinct.",not_statement,
Amendment 151 to clause 41 supplements the power to make regulations in relation to record keeping.,not_statement,
"14:00:00  Before winding up, I will address some other amendments.",not_statement,
I will take this opportunity to note the amendments tabled by my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Luton North (Sarah Owen).,not_statement,
I am grateful to her Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.,not_statement,
The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult and personal experience.,not_statement,
I pay tribute to my hon<prd> Friend for showing great courage in talking about her personal experience of that.,not_statement,
I am grateful to her and to other hon<prd> Members and campaigners for speaking about that issue—we have heard them.,not_statement,
"We fully accept the principle of bereavement leave for pregnancy loss, as addressed by the amendments.",not_statement,
We look forward to further discussions with my hon<prd> Friend and noble Lords as the Bill moves on to its stages in the other place.,not_statement,
I will also take this opportunity to note the new clauses tabled by my hon<prd> Friends the Members for Poplar and Limehouse (Apsana Begum) and for Lowestoft (Jess Asato).,not_statement,
"The Government recognise the important points raised by both hon<prd> Friends, and the serious impact that domestic abuse has on society, particularly on women and girls.",not_statement,
We strongly encourage employers to support staff who experience domestic abuse.,not_statement,
The Government have committed to halving violence against women and girls in a decade.,not_statement,
"I have met the Minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Birmingham Yardley (Jess Phillips), who is, as the House knows, a dedicated and respected campaigner on those issues.",not_statement,
"I have also spoken to several Members about their concerns, including my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Gloucester (Alex McIntyre), whose private Member’s Bill—the Domestic Abuse (Safe Leave) Bill—has been given its First Reading; my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Lowestoft; and the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Alex Davies-Jones).",not_statement,
Members shared many powerful stories from their constituents.,not_statement,
Every part of Government will need to contribute towards our ambition.,not_statement,
"Jerome Mayhew (Broadland and Fakenham) (Con) When my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Alison Griffiths) asked a moment ago which businesses support the Bill, the Minister mentioned the British Chambers of Commerce.",not_statement,
"I have just visited its website, which states:  “The British Chambers of Commerce has used an evidence session on the Employment Rights Bill to highlight businesses’ serious concerns about the legislation and the speed and detail of consultation.",not_statement,
”  Will the Minister withdraw his comment?,not_statement,
Justin Madders I am glad that the hon<prd> Member has access to the internet.,not_statement,
"I direct him to the Department’s webpage, where he will see that Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said:  “There is much here to welcome as sensible moves that will help ensure that employment works for both the business and the individual”.",not_statement,
"That was in response to the amendments, so it is a much more up-to-date comment than the one the hon<prd> Member mentioned.",not_statement,
"Returning to the important issue of violence against women and girls, it is incumbent on every part of Government to work together to tackle violence against women and girls.",not_statement,
That is not a task for a single Department or Minister.,not_statement,
"The Government are steadfastly committed to delivering our manifesto commitment to halving violence against women and girls, and we will publish a cross-Government strategy shortly.",not_statement,
I intend to work with colleagues to ensure that our Department does its bit in that respect.,not_statement,
I also take this opportunity to note the amendments tabled by my right hon<prd> Friend the Member for Sheffield Heeley (Louise Haigh) and the hon<prd> Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran) on non-disclosure agreements.,not_statement,
I have met advocates on that issue and I understand the significant problems that they have highlighted in relation to the misuse of non-disclosure agreements in some circumstances.,not_statement,
That important issue warrants further consideration.,not_statement,
We take NDA misuse seriously and will continue to look into it to see what we can do.,not_statement,
"Sir Julian Smith (Skipton and Ripon) (Con) New clause 72, in the name of the hon<prd> Member for Leeds Central and Headingley (Alex Sobel), focuses on whistleblowing and protected disclosures.",not_statement,
"That area has been so important in recent public scandals, including the Post Office-Fujitsu scandal and the Lucy Letby case.",not_statement,
May I urge the Minister to consider that new clause?,not_statement,
Employment Rights Bill: Employment Rates  Paul Holmes (Hamble Valley) (Con) 4.,not_statement,
Whether she has had discussions with the Secretary of State for Business and Trade on the potential impact of the Employment Rights Bill on employment rates.,not_statement,
The Minister for Employment (Alison McGovern) I meet regularly with Business and Trade Ministers.,not_statement,
We are committed to working with businesses to ensure that policy is pro-employer and pro-worker.,not_statement,
"In fact, since I have been at the DWP, I have found that employers have not had sufficient contact from jobcentres and only one in six employers think about using them.",not_statement,
That is what a real growth agenda looks like from DWP.,not_statement,
"Deirdre Costigan (Ealing Southall) (Lab) Lá Fhéile Pádraig Sona Duit—a happy St Patrick’s day to you, Mr Speaker, and all your team.",not_statement,
Alison McGovern May I first say how great it is to hear the beautiful language of Irish spoken in this Chamber?,not_statement,
Employment Rights Bill  Debate resumed.,not_statement,
Gregory Stafford It is always a pleasure to follow the King.,not_statement,
[Laughter.,not_statement,
"] Nothing has highlighted more clearly than this debate the old adage that where we think the Labour party is wrong, it thinks that we are evil.",not_statement,
"Nothing that has come from Labour Members has given any consideration to the absolutely correct concerns that the shadow Minister, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith), raised in his opening remarks.",not_statement,
"Even the Government’s own impact assessment, which Opposition Members have mentioned on a number of occasions, concedes that business will face a staggering £5 billion in additional costs: an economic straitjacket that will choke innovation and job creation.",not_statement,
"Labour Members seem to have failed to realise that being pro-business, as the Conservatives are, is being pro-worker, because if businesses do not exist there will be no one to employ workers.",not_statement,
"In my constituency alone we have over 5,000 businesses, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises.",not_statement,
"Many of them operate in the education, retail and hospitality sectors, which rely on flexibility to survive, Lincoln Jopp (Spelthorne) (Con) Gregory Stafford My hon<prd> Friend makes a good point.",not_statement,
"I think of the University for the Creative Arts students who rely on flexible work and the NHS paramedic in Farnham picking up extra shifts at the Nelson Arms, as I mentioned earlier.",not_statement,
"UKHospitality has been clear that for 90% of workers on zero-hours contracts, that is their preference.",not_statement,
"The sector relies on these contracts to manage fluctuating demand, and removing that flexibility could devastate those businesses and lead to job losses.",not_statement,
There is no job security for those who do not have a job.,not_statement,
"Similarly, the right to request flexible working must be assessed properly.",not_statement,
"Madam Deputy Speaker, I fear the clock may not have started for my speech, so I will draw to a close.",not_statement,
[Hon.,not_statement,
Members: “More!,not_statement,
More!,not_statement,
"”] In that case, I shall carry on!",not_statement,
"No, no; I am conscious of my hon<prd> Friends who wish to speak.",not_statement,
This Government seem to have learned nothing from history.,not_statement,
"We have heard history lessons from Government Members, most of which have seemed to take us back to the 1970s.",not_statement,
Economic success does not come from shackling businesses with red tape or giving trade unions unchecked power.,not_statement,
"It comes from fostering an environment where employers can hire, invest and grow.",not_statement,
"Steve Witherden (Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr) (Lab) I am proud to declare my membership of Unite the union and the NASUWT, and I refer Members to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.",not_statement,
"Before I was elected, I was a teacher for 20 years.",not_statement,
Chris Vince (Harlow) (Lab/Co-op) My hon<prd> Friend is giving one of his trademark passionate speeches.,not_statement,
Steve Witherden I wholeheartedly agree with everything my hon<prd> Friend has said.,not_statement,
"We have all felt the effects of a system that has left so many behind: flatlined wages, insecure work and falling living standards.",not_statement,
Diolch yn fawr.,not_statement,
Alison Bennett (Mid Sussex) (LD) Carers UK estimates that the value to the economy of carers being able to work is £5<prd>3 billion.,not_statement,
"When I have met major blue-chip employers such as Centrica and HSBC, and their employees who have benefited from those corporations’ carers policies, The 2<prd>8 million people who juggle a job and caring responsibilities are going above and beyond to care for those they love while also contributing to our economy.",not_statement,
We must acknowledge their work with a fair deal for them.,not_statement,
I know that this is something the carers in my constituency deserve.,not_statement,
They deserve better.,not_statement,
We must be adaptable to the changing needs of our population while also seeing the benefits.,not_statement,
This really can be a win-win.,not_statement,
We know that being a carer makes people much more likely to fall into poverty.,not_statement,
"Carers UK’s research also tells us that almost half of all those who left employment early to fulfil a caring responsibility say that they would have stayed in employment longer, had carer’s leave on a paid basis existed.",not_statement,
"Mrs Russell I need to highlight to the House that I am a member of the Community and USDAW trade unions, and I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.",not_statement,
I would like to speak to various bits of this legislation today.,not_statement,
"There is so much in it, and I know that so many of us on the Government Back Benches are really pleased with what we are bringing forward.",not_statement,
"The first part of the legislation that I want to address is clause 22, which will bring forward in future legislation more protections for women who are pregnant, on maternity leave and in the period immediately following their maternity leave.",not_statement,
"I have spent the past 13 years representing large numbers of women who were either made redundant while pregnant, on maternity leave or trying to come back from maternity leave, or whose employer suddenly woke up one morning and decided that they were underperforming, often within 24 hours of their announcing their pregnancy.",not_statement,
"I had a client who had been headhunted and brought into the company, was totally stellar, doing incredibly well and got promoted, but then announced her pregnancy and within a week she was on a performance plan.",not_statement,
"HR explained to her that because they were, you know, kind and did not want to do that to her while she was pregnant, they were very generously offering her a settlement agreement so that she did not have to go through that.",not_statement,
"Lots of perfectly decent people do not understand why they are losing their jobs, and it is because they are pregnant.",not_statement,
"Pregnant Then Screwed found that 12<prd>3% of women who have had a baby have either been sacked, constructively dismissed or made redundant while pregnant, on maternity leave or within a year of their maternity leave ending.",not_statement,
"Lola McEvoy My hon<prd> Friend, who has great expertise in this area, is making an eloquent speech.",not_statement,
The second element I like in the legislation is the improvements to the right to request flexible working.,not_statement,
Those on the Conservative Benches have questioned why we would do this.,not_statement,
"Conservative Members have talked a lot about clause 17 and the third-party harassment elements, and it is worth getting into some of the detail.",not_statement,
The defence for an employer for failing to protect their staff from third-party harassment is taking all reasonable steps to prevent that harassment from occurring.,not_statement,
"Employment tribunals have been interpreting the meaning of “reasonable” for a long time, and in a discrimination claim there is essentially a three-part judiciary: a judge with legal experience, someone with employer experience, and someone with employee experience—sometimes from a trade union, but sometimes from elsewhere.",not_statement,
Wera Hobhouse The hon<prd> Member is speaking powerfully.,not_statement,
Mrs Russell I completely and utterly agree with the hon<prd> Member.,not_statement,
"Actually, a lot of what is coming from Conservative Members is scaremongering.",not_statement,
