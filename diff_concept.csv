However, we also need to maintain a reasonable balance between the ability of workers to strike and the rights of the public, who work hard and expect the essential services that they pay for to be there when they need them. We must be able to have confidence that when strikes occur, peopleâ€™s lives and livelihoods are not put at undue risk. As has become clear from recent industrial action, that is not always the case, so we need a safety net in place to ensure that the public do not become collateral damage.	BALANC	RELATE
it is perfectly proper to have a balance between minimum service levels and peopleâ€™s right to strike.	BALANC	RIGHTS
It is fairly obvious to say that a minimum service level in railways, for example, is about peopleâ€™s livelihoods rather than safety, but that the NHS and the ambulance service not agreeing nationally is a minimum safety level issue.	PHYSICAL	ECONOMIC
The Bill will ensure that we protect the ability of workers to take industrial action, but that we also protect the public from disproportionate disruption to their daily lives and that, to put it simply, one personâ€™s right to strike does not infringe on someone elseâ€™s right to life and limb.

The human rights memorandum that accompanied the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill last October stated specifically that the Governmentâ€™s legal advice was that it is not justifiable or necessary in a democratic society to have such restrictions in emergency and patient care services, in fire and rescue, or in educationâ€”only in transport.

Backing our Liberal Democrat amendment to make carerâ€™s leave a paid entitlement would be the right thing to do on a human level and would also support the Governmentâ€™s growth agenda. For a Government on a mission to spend less while also delivering growth and better living standards, this is a no-brainer. We must do everything we can to help those carers who can and want to work to do so.	JUST	JUST

Many of them are on low incomes, they are often women, and they cannot afford to use their right to carerâ€™s leave unless it becomes a paid right.	RIGHTS	RIGHTS
When people apply for jobs, equality monitoring forms do not ask them whether they have unpaid caring responsibilities.

Despite what people may have read in some reports, this Bill is not a declaration of war on the trade union movement. It is not an attempt to ban industrial action. It is not an attack on the rights of working people. It will not force strikers to seek police approval for their slogans or their tweets. It is not a reprise of Prime Minister Clement Attlee sending in troops to break up perfectly legal stoppages. It is simply the latest stage in the long journey of modernisation and reform. It will put power in the hands of the mass membership, bring much-needed sunlight to dark corners of the movement, and protect the rights of everyone in this country—those who are union members and those who are not, and those hard-working men and women who are hit hardest by industrial action.

If this Bill was to be supported by the workers generally, some trade unions would already have given it support.

If this is such a fair and reasonable Bill, why does the right hon. Gentleman’s predecessor, Vince Cable, say that it is both “vindictive” and “unnecessary”?	RELATE	JUST
Hon. Members from both sides of this House are, to some extent, insulated from the consequences of strike action. We are lucky enough to have generous travel expenses so that we can hire a car or a taxi when there is a transport strike. We have secure jobs, where we get paid whether we make it into the office or not. Even a Back Bencher is among the top 5% of UK earners, so  we can afford to deal with the childcare costs that might come with a school closure or some disruption. But what about the low-paid restaurant staff who miss a day’s work and a day’s pay because of a stoppage called by a handful of transport workers? What about the self-employed builder who has to turn down a week-long job because a strike by teachers means that his kids cannot go to school? What about the single mother who cannot afford to lose a day’s pay by refusing to cross a picket line? Should she be subjected to abuse and harassment simply for going to work?	BALANC	BALANC
My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. At the heart of this Bill is partnership—partnership between trade unions and employers and other stakeholders. A great example of that can be seen at Toyota in Britain. It has not had one day of industrial action in  20 years, and that is because of the partnership that it rightly has with its trade union	ECONOMIC	RELATE
The Secretary of State is giving the House the impression that London commuters would somehow be protected by his threshold. Is he aware that the recent industrial action on the tube  would have passed those thresholds? He talks about partnership. Is it not the case that it is not the strikes and the ballots that are the problems, but the intransigent Mayor of London who is sitting behind him?	ACCESS	POLIT
Let me move on to thresholds. The whole point of strikes is to cause disruption, but the impact of industrial action on ordinary people—often the very working people whom unions were created to support—is such that it should ever be used only as a last resort. It should be taken only after the explicit backing of a majority of members. That is why this Bill sets a minimum turnout of 50% for industrial action ballots. If 1,000 union members are being asked to participate in a strike, at least 500 of them must vote for the ballot to be valid.	BALANC	BALANC
I also wish to highlight the additional requirement for ballots of staff in six key sectors: the health service, the fire service,  border security and nuclear decommissioning—because of the obvious risks to public safety and security—and education and transport. A ballot is required because of the massive disproportionate disruption that stoppages in those areas can cause.	PHYSICAL	PHYSICAL
 She is right that strikes should always be a last resort—I think that is the point she is making. If union members wish to take strike action, they will vote for it and meet the proposed thresholds.	RIGHTS	RIGHTS
The Bill provides that voting papers sent to union members and employers will state the details of the trade dispute, exactly what type of industrial action is proposed, and an indication of the time period in which that action will take place. This will ensure that members know exactly what they are voting for or against and allow them to make an informed decision.	REPLIC	AUTONOMY

 There is no transparency around how much time they spend on union work and no controls in place to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money. It is a situation that most ordinary Britons, including many dedicated public servants I have spoken to, find absolutely baffling. That is why civil service Departments are already required to publish information about the use of facility time by their staff. The Bill allows the Government to make regulations extending that to all public sector employers. It will include information about an employer’s spending on trade union duties and activities and about how many of its union representatives spend a specified percentage of their time on their union role. We have already made considerable savings for the taxpayer by requiring Departments to publish this information, as we have just heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (James Heappey).

The hypocrisy of this Government in trying to stop trade unions paying into the political levy is obvious. The political levy goes not just to the Labour party but to a lot of organisations. It could be asked why the Government are doing this. Perhaps they are trying to stop trade unionists putting money into Labour, perhaps they want to crush the party by stopping its money.

A trade union should be, I believe, a body that concerns itself with the rights and welfare of its members. It should be an organisation that strives to improve the working lives of people.

What a trade union should not be is a deliberately destructive force, seeking to hold back the economy of the country and unduly inconvenience, or—worse still—endanger other members of society.

I suggest to the Minister that seeking to reduce “facility time” by publicising it, which does not take account of its exact nature, poses a risk that genuine HR matters may be unfairly neglected. I think that the Bill should clarify the position by making a subtle but important distinction between the sub-types of facility time, which should be carried through to the point of publication that the Bill stipulates. Such a clarification would surely be in line with the spirit of a measure that is, after all, designed to promote transparency and public scrutiny of “facility time”.	REPLIC	REPLIC
This piece of proposed legislation is not really about picket lines, armbands and social media.

The Bill is part of a jigsaw of legislation that the Government have forced through during more than one parliamentary term. They are extending the role of the certification officer in regulating trade unions, which includes the granting of a new power to impose fines.

Unions have always been powerful advocates for their members’ rights, but it is important that we find a balance between the right of union members to strike and the rights of millions of working people to access the vital public services they rely on and to go about their daily lives without disruption.

In sum, this Bill ensures that unions can continue to play a valuable role, doing the work they do best while operating with the transparency, fairness and democracy they need to retain the public’s confidence.

Peaceful protest is an important part of an open and democratic society, and there should be no place for a law that makes criminals of people making their voices heard in this way.

The Bill dictates that industrial action, including strike action, will only be lawful if a minimum 50% turnout among those trade union members entitled to vote is achieved, while additionally requiring 40% of those members balloted to vote in favour of industrial action across what the Government term “important public services”. This term is of great significance. The Tory manifesto, as well as the subsequent Queen’s Speech briefings, stated that the 40% requirement would apply only to four “essential public services”: health, fire, transport and education services. Yet the Government have now extended this list to include other sectors, such as border security, the decommissioning of nuclear installations and the management of radioactive waste.	REPLIC	REPLIC
I would also welcome any clarity the Minister can provide around how he intends to escape the inevitable confusion arising when attempting to ballot a workplace where some occupations are covered by the “important public services” provisions and others are not. Will the Minister give further details on the requirement for “reasonably detailed” information to be provided on ballot papers?

Thirdly, the Bill works to redress the balance between striking and non-striking workers through the proposals to minimise the disruption caused by strike action. It is perfectly sensible to require 14 days’ notice of a strike. It would also be sensible, for example, that if the teachers at my daughter’s school were to go on strike, agency workers could be brought in so that my children’s education would not be disrupted.

Interestingly, given where the Labour party is at this stage, Labour Members have a choice: are they going to embrace the modern world and be on the side of workers—people in their constituencies who go out to work every day and do not want to be disrupted —or are they going to go back to the same old arguments that we thought had been settled 20 or 30 years ago? Interestingly, the measures taken then have never been repealed by the Labour party. I am absolutely clear which side I am on and which side the Conservative party is on. We are on the side of ordinary, hard-working people, while maintaining the right to strike. That is why I shall be voting in favour of this legislation.	BALANC	BALANC
I also come here, however, as someone who knows that the most challenging situations and all the difficult discussions were entirely more productive and more effective, and carried more weight, because they were dealt with in partnership with trade unions. I did not always agree with my trade union counterparts, and they certainly did not always agree with me, but that is surely the point: sometimes there will be different perspectives, and that is entirely healthy and appropriate. It is clear that when tough decisions have to be made, communication is the key to an effective and productive workplace culture. We do need to accept, however, that occasionally we will not agree, no matter how much discussion we have had—that is a fact of life—and no Bill will make employers and staff agree on everything.

What this Bill will do is: ensure that any disagreement is squashed by management, without any constructive dialogue, render any dialogue that there is futile, and ensure that the important and constructive voices of staff are lost, drowned in a welter of arguments about  minutiae of process or brushed aside.

In the last four years of the last millennium—1996 to 1999—there were 199,000 days lost from private sector strikes, compared with 278,000 from public sector strikes.

First, on the issue of the 40% additional threshold, I am pleased that the Government are looking at consultation, but the points made about the ability of the union leadership to control and minimise wildcat strikes do carry quite a weight. It would be interesting for the Minister to consider whether the notice period of 14 days before strike action will achieve most of the goals that are seen as required for that 40% threshold. May I encourage the Minister to include in clause 6(1), on information to the certification officer, a provision about the outcome of the industrial action? That information is useful for members, too. If they are asked to go on strike, they should know what the consequence of the strike was—what they achieved by it—so they can see whether such action is playing a good role.	REPLIC	REPLIC

Moreover, I challenge  the assertion made by some Opposition Members that union activity does not stoke excessive strike action. It is instructive to compare days lost due to strike action in the private sector, where union membership is relatively low, with days lost in the public sector, where union membership is more widespread.

My hon. Friend the Member for Blyth  Valley (Mr Campbell) and other hon. Members have made interesting comparisons with hedge funds, the banking system and the financial sector. Such organisations and institutions promoted the casino economy that brought Britain, and indeed the world, to the brink of financial disaster. Yet, they seem to be allowed to wield considerable and unfettered political influence, and there is no proposal for similar constraints or levels of transparency. Our recovery is being built on a private debt bubble, and as austerity fails to eradicate the deficit or to improve the income or living standards for ordinary people, it is more important than ever for them to have a trade union to represent their interests.	ECONOMIC	ADEQ
In addition to significant and unnecessary new burdens, trade unions will also be expected to pay a levy to fund the certification officers’ new role. As we heard from the Secretary of State, the role will be much more proactive. They will have new powers to impose financial penalties and to scrutinise how unions use their political funds and for what purposes.	ACCESS	POWER
It seems clear to me that, in putting forward this Bill, the Government fail to understand the value of trade unions’ contribution to working practices, health and safety, productivity and the economy. The Government say that the aims of this Bill are to enable the UK to pursue an ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by 2030, and to ensure that hard-working people are not disrupted by strike action.  I believe that, far from delivering those aims, the Bill is likely to work against them.	ECONOMIC	ECONOMIC

On picketing, I stood on a picket line in my constituency in 2011. Six careworkers from 10 to 22 years’ service faced being sacked by a Conservative council. Under the Bill, they would have had to report to and give their names to the police. As one of them said to me last week, “Jack, we’re not criminals.” As a police officer said to me last week in the west midlands, “Jack, this is not a police state.”	JUST	JUST
It is an attack not just on freedom of association but on freedom of speech. People have to give notice of what they are going to put on a blog or on Twitter.

The freedom to speak out against injustice and to campaign for economic equality and the rights and freedoms of workers is underpinned by the European convention on human rights—rights that were bitterly fought for by the blood, sweat and tears of our ancestors. The Government claim that they are forced to amend those rights, and we are led to believe that that is because the number of strikes called in recent years is a threat to our economic wellbeing. The total number of days lost in the 12 months preceding April 2015 was  704,000, but before the House becomes hysterical about that, it is important to note that historically that figure was in the millions. In fact, we are experiencing an all-time low for strike action, and it is at its lowest level since before 1990. The simple truth is that workers do not take the decision to strike lightly, and they never have.	ECONOMIC	AUTONOMY
Let us leave human rights to one side for a moment and examine the next strand of the Government’s argument, which is that trade union activity and the right to collectively bargain poses an economic threat. That is simply not the case. Evidence provided by the New Economics Foundation recently concluded that as a wage-led economy, the UK’s prosperity depends on a substantial share of the national income going to wages.	ECONOMIC	ECONOMIC
I stress that such rights are not simply to improve workers’ living standards, but to enable the functioning of the economy as a whole. If wages continue to fall in real terms that implies a shrinking of the market. That inhibits profit and growth, and results in a vast reduction in the amounts recoverable in taxes by the Treasury. Indeed, proponents of the competitive market—including those on the Government Benches—would do well to understand that intrinsic to its very existence is not just the supply and demand of labour, but the freedom of labour to move and organise. Members who are fans of the free market mantras of Milton Friedman and co. will no doubt notice a real contradiction in terms. On the one hand, the Government advocate freedom and deregulation of company activity in their promotion of free market ideologies, but when it comes to the activity of workers it is a completely different story.

Interestingly, when he quoted Clement Attlee the Secretary of State did not mention that it was Attlee’s Labour Government in 1946 that reversed that necessity to opt in to the political levy, because that was regarded as taking away power and balancing it too far from workers in the workplace.

Some kind of disruptive industrial action, bad enough to wreck one’s day, can take place on the basis of a tiny number of the workforce. To take a by no means untypical example, a strike was recently mooted upon the dismissal of an employee who had consistently failed to turn up for work, and a ballot was held by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. Fifty-four people were balloted. Of those, only 14 could be bothered to vote. Five voted for a strike and nine for action short of a strike. Yet, as a result of the vote—26% of the relevant electorate—people’s lives were disrupted during that day. People did not turn up to work. The London economy suffered. There was disruption.	ECONOMIC	ECONOMIC
This is an excellent Bill—a serious, sensible Bill. It has been striking that not a single Labour Member has stood up during this debate to condemn the strikes that are caused by a tiny minority of the workforce.

ADEQ	ADEQ
Reading the Bill, I have a strong sense that those drafting it do not understand how the system works, and I urge Government Members to think through the unintended consequences. Thanks to previous Conservative legislation, unions have been forced to maintain political funds to carry out their mainstream functions. Unison’s predecessor union, the National and Local Government Officers’ Association, famously had to do that to campaign on behalf of its members just for public services—core union business. Yet the Bill muddles maintaining the political fund with links to the Labour party, and in attacking the latter muddies the waters still further.	ADEQ	ADEQ

Grant Shapps I am surprised by how the hon<prd> Gentleman, who normally speaks a lot of sense in the House, put his point across.	RELATE	nonstatement
Yes, of course it is the case that the NHS has been under unbelievable stress, not least because of two years of covid and all the backlog that has been created.	ADEQ	nonstatement

I do not follow the logic of his argument.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
He seems to be arguing that just because there are times of danger, we ought, by design, to enable a system that prevents unions in the ambulance service from telling the NHS when ambulances will be there and what the minimum service would be.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement

One at a time.	RELATE	nonstatement
The way that ambulance strike worked was that the NHS was unable to find out in advance from the ambulance unions where and when, nationwide, cover would be provided.	ADEQ	nonstatement
It is the NHS that said that, not the Government.	ADEQ	nonstatement
As a result, the NHS has not been able to put the appropriate level of cover in place in advance.	ADEQ	nonstatement

Grant Shapps I simply do not accept that point.	ADEQ	nonstatement

Can the Secretary of State confirm that this legislation cannot possibly be used to sort out the present winter of discontent?	ADEQ	nonstatement
If anything, it will make it far more difficult to secure a resolution of any of the individual strikes, and therefore it is just political posturing.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Grant Shapps I think the GMB will have heard the hon<prd> Gentlemanâ€™s pitch for some money.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
If he gets that money, it will join the Â£120 million that the unions have supplied to the Labour party since 2010.	POLIT	nonstatement
I make this point only because it is relevant to todayâ€™s debate.	ADEQ	nonstatement
We must be here to represent our constituents, and our constituents know from paying attention to the recent strikes that when the Royal College of Nursing worked with the NHS, it was able to provide timely assurances at a national level to ensure that the most critical servicesâ€”including chemotherapy, critical care, paediatric and A&amp;Eâ€”were not affected, which shows that even when parties disagree, they can do so in a mature manner.	BALANC	nonstatement
Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case.	RELATE	nonstatement
During recent strike action by the ambulance serviceâ€”this has been referred to a couple of times, and I want to read it out because it is written downâ€”the NHS has not been reassured by the relevant union that it can rely on the current system of voluntary local derogation, which I think is what the hon<prd> Member for York Central was talking about earlier.	ADEQ	nonstatement
It could not rely on those arrangements to ensure that patient and public services were provided.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Last week, and in December, arrangements were being disputed right up to the wireâ€”right up to the last minuteâ€”which created uncertainty and left officials with little time to organise contingency measures such as military support.	ADEQ	nonstatement

I know from talking to colleagues and officials that one of the problems was that, because of the late notice and the randomised trust-by-trust agreements, they have been unable to put in a national framework that would mean that it would not matter if you lived in Islington North or somewhere else; you would still get coverage on strike days.

The railways on strike days are finding it hard to offer any services at all, even for key workers and the people the Opposition sometimes claim to represent the most, such as the hard-working cleaner or the hospital porter.	RELATE	nonstatement

This Bill could increase the frequency of strikes and the  â€œnumbers of staff taking action short of strikingâ€  and lead to employers finding that they are â€œlow on staff.	RELATE	nonstatement
â€ Again, those are not my words but the words of the Department for Transportâ€™s impact assessment.	POLIT	nonstatement
Minimum service levels are â€œnot a game-changerâ€ and could  â€œpromote more industrial action than they mitigate.	RIGHTS	nonstatement

These measures will not work, cannot work and will only make things worse.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
James Sunderland (Bracknell) (Con) I remind the House that we have a number of sectors in the UK in which employees are not allowed to strike, namely the armed forces and the police.	COMPAR	nonstatement

Angela Rayner I am glad the hon<prd> Gentleman got the crib sheet from the Whips.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
There is a complete and utter lack of clarity about what these measures will mean for the six sectors to which they will apply.	ADEQ	nonstatement
In nuclear decommissioning, for example, staff already have voluntary arrangements.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
How will Ministers define minimum service in this sector?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Will they require just a teeny bit of decommissioning?	PHYSICAL	nonstatement

Will Ministers seriously sack doctors, nurses, paramedics and vital support staff at a time of critical NHS staff shortages?	RELATE	nonstatement
Apparently not, if the Government sources reported this week can be believed.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Does the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy deny that the Health Secretary has told others to lobby the Prime Minister for improved pay offers?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
And can he really say that the Health Secretary believes this Bill will help the NHS?	RELATE	nonstatement
The Bill states that all transport services will be covered, but the industry is largely in the private sector.	JUST	nonstatement
Does the Secretary of State expect, for example, self-employed cabbies to serve work notices to themselves?	ENFORCE	nonstatement
There seem to be a split here, too; I hear that the Transport Secretary has given rail companies permission for new pay offers, and we already know his views on minimum service levels.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Let us move on to education.	BALANC	nonstatement
Will our overstretched headteachers be forced to write and serve work notices in their own staffrooms?	ENFORCE	nonstatement
Does the Business Secretary agree with the Education Secretary that imposing these regulations on schools would be a hostile act?	REPLIC	nonstatement
Let us turn to fire and rescue services.	RIGHTS	nonstatement

Angela Rayner I will just educate the hon<prd> Gentleman: although I used to be a trade union official and I am a member of a trade union, I do not negotiate on behalf of a trade union.	ADEQ	nonstatement
But what I would do is sit around the table and resolve this dispute with the trade unions.	RELATE	nonstatement
That would be better than what the Conservatives have done.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
I come to the liability this Bill places upon trade unions.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
It says that trade unions must take â€œreasonable stepsâ€ to ensure workers comply with work notices, but what would they be?	BALANC	nonstatement
Will trade unions be liable for non-union staff?	BALANC	nonstatement
As for the burden put on employers, have they welcomed the bureaucratic nightmare that they will face?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
How will our already overstretched public services spare the resources to work out how many workers are needed to meet the minimum service levels the Secretary of State arbitrarily imposes on them, and to identify which workers should come into work and which should not?	RIGHTS	nonstatement

Let us look at what this Bill is really all about: a Government who are out of ideas, out of time and fast running out of sticking plasters; a Government who are playing politics with nursesâ€™ lives because they cannot stomach negotiation; a Government desperately doing all they can to distract from the economic emergency they have caused.	RELATE	nonstatement
We have had 13 years of failure, and working people of this country cannot take any more.	BALANC	nonstatement

Angela Rayner The hon<prd> Gentleman makes some important and valid points.	BALANC	nonstatement
In the past 12 months to two and a half years, we have seen the unravelling of the VIP fast-track lane for people linked to the Conservative partyâ€”that was a waste of billions of pounds that could have gone into investment in our public services.	ADEQ	nonstatement
The public have seen 13 years of Conservative failure.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Most of the public who are watching this debate today can ask themselves one question: do they feel better off after 13 years of the Conservatives?	POLIT	nonstatement
The answer to that question is no, unless of course they are in that 1%, with a WhatsApp number of a Government Minister.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Labour would have resolved these disputes a long time ago, by getting back around the negotiating table in good faith and doing a deal.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Geraint Davies (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op) Is my right hon<prd> Friend aware that the Labour Government in Wales were given more than Â£1 billion for personal protective equipment and test, track and trace, and spent only Â£500 million?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
If we had had that level of savings, instead of having Tory crony donors putting their hand in the till, it would have aggregated up to a saving of Â£11 billion, as against a total pay cost to the NHS of Â£56 billion?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
In other words, we are talking about 20% of the annual pay for all nurses and all health workers.	RELATE	nonstatement
So does she not agree that if we had a Labour Government, we would have more money to provide decent wages for those in our health service?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my hon<prd> Friend; not only would we have grown the economyâ€”and we have a plan to grow the economy, unlike the Conservatives â€”but we would not have wasted billions of pounds and we would not have crashed the economy like the Conservatives did.

I pay tribute to our hard-working frontline public sector workers.	BALANC	nonstatement
On Friday, I visited workers at the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, who have not been on strike, and all credit to them.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
In the operational control centres, people have been working diligently, day in, day out, to manage, quite frankly, the many, many challenging cases.	ADEQ	nonstatement
This House will understand my particular interest in operational frontline workers, especially when it comes to the police, who cannot strike, and also fire and rescue workers and Border Force officers.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Just last year, I was able to use existing Home Office budgets to provide the police with a pay increase.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
It was a 5% pay increase across the board and one of the largest settlements in the public sector.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
I accepted the recommendation from the Police Remuneration Review Body, and it was my right hon<prd> Friend the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse), who is in his place, who oversaw that settlement.	REPLIC	nonstatement
That funding was vital because we on the Conservative Benches believe in our frontline public sector workers.	POLIT	nonstatement
We believe in giving them the resources that they need and the working conditions in which they can do their jobs, but within the affordability of the Governmentâ€™s financial envelope, which is incredibly important.	BALANC	nonstatement
Janet Daby (Lewisham East) (Lab) Is the right hon<prd> Lady aware that the Secretary of Stateâ€™s own colleaguesâ€”the Secretaries of State for Transport and for Educationâ€”believe that the Bill will not solve the strikes?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Priti Patel I say to the hon<prd> Lady and to all Members in the House that we are facing fundamental economic challenges right now, and they have to be met within the financial envelope of this Government.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
That is a statement of the obvious.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement

He boasted that his Government were introducing â€œanti-strikeâ€ legislation in a rare bit of honesty from the Dispatch Box.	CREATE	nonstatement
The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy keeps going on about minimum ambulance cover, but the reality is that this is an attack on millions of public sector workers.	ADEQ	nonstatement
The explanatory notes tell us that this is a Tory manifesto commitment about tackling transport strikes.	REPLIC	nonstatement
Although the Conservatives might hide behind that manifesto commitment, that commitment has nothing to do with clamping down on the NHS or on teachers.	RELATE	nonstatement
The Conservatives claim that it is about safety, but, as I said earlier, the word â€œsafetyâ€ is not used once in the Bill or in explanatory notes.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The reality is that this is an ideological war on the unions, which the Tories somehow think will curry favour with the public.	POLIT	nonstatement
It is a misty-eyed look back to Margaret Thatcher taking on the National Union of Mineworkers.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
It was a battle that she won, but it was a battle that resulted in the closures of mines and left communities devasted and thousands of workers on the dole.	POLIT	nonstatement
Do we really want to go back to sacking workers and putting them on the dole?	BALANC	nonstatement
That is what this is all about.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
We know that this is an ideological war, because, in this period of Tory governance, the Government have already given us the Trade Union Act 2016, introducing voting thresholds, and then, last year, the legislation to allow employers to hire agency staff to break strikes.	REPLIC	nonstatement
There is no doubt that this Government want to end strikes, effectively removing the ultimate backstop on collective bargaining.	JUST	nonstatement
The Bill not only facilitates an attack on workers, but enables employers to potentially sue unions for damages.	RELATE	nonstatement
It is no wonder that it is opposed by the TUC, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Unison, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing among others, and I certainly support them in opposing this.	COLLECTIVE	nonstatement
Neither the Scottish Government nor the Welsh Government want this legislation, but, yet again, this legislation will be imposed on the devolved nations.	RELATE	nonstatement
In Scotland, this is further proof that the Westminster straitjacket does us no good at all.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
We could have had employment and workersâ€™ rights devolved, but, unfortunately, Labour resisted those powers coming to Scotland.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
However, even the STUC has now called for the devolution of employment rights to Scotland, so perhaps Labour should consider that, instead of listening to Gordon Brownâ€™s rehash of broken promises.	POLIT	nonstatement
It is worth noting that the Bill does not impact Northern Ireland, as employment law is already devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, so, yet again, the so-called most powerful devolved Parliament in the worldâ€”the Scottish Parliamentâ€”has fewer powers than the Northern Ireland Assembly, and this proves it.	LEGAL	nonstatement
This ideological attack comes from someone who, as Transport Secretary, was non-existent when it came to dialogue and communications, and that was confirmed by the unions.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
He was somebody who was blocking the DFT from agreeing deals, and now we have that same person in post leading the charge for anti-strike and anti-worker legislation.	JUST	nonstatement
Given the Secretary of Stateâ€™s form, we know that he is up for a fight, but even if wins this fight, he will be destroying worker relationships for good.	JUST	nonstatement
These are hard-pressed workers, particularly from within the NHS, who are struggling at times with the pressures that they are under.	POLIT	nonstatement
Who seriously thinks that not negotiating and threatening workers with the sack for striking will help matters?	CREATE	nonstatement
It is utterly insane.	RELATE	nonstatement
As the rail unions pointed out at the Transport Committee last week, deals have been agreed where DfT and UK Ministers are not involved.	REPLIC	nonstatement
Clearly the union asks cannot be too unreasonable, when RMT and ASLEF have agreed deals with ScotRail and the Scottish Government, deals in Wales and deals with Merseyrail, for exampleâ€”deals with Governments and authorities that have been hamstrung by the Tory austerity imposed on them, yet still managed to agree deals.	REPLIC	nonstatement
The Tories tell us they are the party of workers.	POLIT	nonstatement
That phrase fools no one, but they also tell us they are all about a high-wage, skilled economy.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Yet, as we have heard, when workers ask for a wage rise they are told no, that it is unaffordable; even worse, in the case of the rail unions, the Secretary of State quotes figures that he thinks show how well paid all rail staff are.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
That is really telling: the Secretary of State is effectively saying, â€œTrain drivers are overpaidâ€”how dare they ask for a wage rise?	ENFORCE	nonstatement
â€.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
That is insulting beyond belief.	 productivity is flat	nonstatement
The Tories can forget saying they want a high-wage economy.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
They were quite happy for the rail companies to pay dividends during the pandemic.	ADEQ	nonstatement
They were quite happy for Virgin Trains East Coast to walk away from the London North Eastern Railway franchise owing billions of pounds, but they always go for attacking workers.	BALANC	nonstatement
It is the same with the Secretaryâ€™s rhetoric about this legislation mirroring what happens elsewhere in Europe.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
His soundbites are easily proven to be false.	POWER	nonstatement
Indeed, the general secretary of the European Federation of Public Service Unions, Jan Willem Goudriaan, argued that comparison by the UK Government of this Bill with existing laws in other EU countries was misrepresenting the situation, because all minimum service levels in Europe are agreed through negotiation.	COMPAR	nonstatement
Moreover, the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, Esther Lynch, said:  â€œThe UK already has among the most draconian restrictions on the right to strike in Europe, and the UK governmentâ€™s plans would push it even further away from normal, democratic practice across Europeâ€.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Pablo SÃ¡nchez Centellas, a spokesperson for the EPSU, was much more succinct, saying, â€œItâ€™s bollocks.	BALANC	nonstatement
â€ The Secretary of State should reflect on the true position of this proposed legislation compared with what is happening in Europe.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
He has also rightly pointed out that the human rights memorandum that accompanied the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill set out reasons why minimum service levels were not justified in fire services, health settings or education, yet that is what the Government now propose.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
By default, this Government are now going against their own previous human rights opinion.	POLIT	nonstatement
What kind of madness is that?	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
When it comes to the International Labour Organisation, which the Secretary of State likes to reference, its idea of minimum service requirements is clearly intended to be based on endangerment to life, personal safety or health.	REPLIC	nonstatement
This wide-ranging legislation goes way beyond those parameters.	JUST	nonstatement
The ILO makes it clear there should be an independent arbitration body, yet this Bill is completely silent on such a body.	COMPAR	nonstatement
Why is that?	JUST	nonstatement
It is also clear that any minimum service level is supposed to be just thatâ€”a bare minimum.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
We have no idea what this Government will railroad through via statutory instruments.	POLIT	nonstatement
Statutory instruments cannot be amended and the last time a Government was defeated on a statutory instrument was in 1979, so we know all power rests with the Government there.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
As Liberty has observed, the Bill does not create any form of minimal service.	CREATE	nonstatement
Liberty also confirms that MPs debating this legislation on Second Reading will not know exactly what they are voting for, so all the Tory MPs in the Chamber who are going to take part in the debate and then trot through the Lobby will do so blind to what the future legislation and regulations on minimum service will look like.	POLIT	nonstatement
It is an affront to democracy.	JUST	nonstatement
Any Tory MP who claims to care about parliamentary sovereignty cannot possibly vote for this Bill.	COMPAR	nonstatement
The Bill is made worse by the Henry VIII power that allows amendment and revocation even of future legislation not yet passed.	JUST	nonstatement
We can see how the Government are ramming this Bill through Parliament with minimum scrutiny and a proposed programme motion allowing just five hours for Committee.	ADEQ	nonstatement
It really is an assault on democracy.	POLIT	nonstatement
The fact that the Bill comes into effect immediately once passed, so that work notices and actions can be taken by employers for strikes that have already been voted through, shows just how ridiculous this assault on workers is.	POLIT	nonstatement
The impact assessment for the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill observes that on a strike day in July 2022, 20% of rail services were still in operation.	BALANC	nonstatement
Right away that suggests to me that a minimum level of service was operating.	BALANC	nonstatement
What do the Tories really think a minimum service is, if 20% is not a bare minimum?	COMPAR	nonstatement
There are huge ramifications here for rail workers overall, because if this Government force through a high threshold of minimum service, strikes by signalmen and track operatives will effectively be banned.	POLIT	nonstatement
A high minimum service will force all those guys to work to keep the tracks in operation and the trains running, effectively blocking strikes by the back door.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
What will minimum service look like for teachers?	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Where does that fit in with all the talk about safety?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
What happens to train companies that cannot provide a minimum service at the moment, especially if union members decide not to work on their rest days and to work to rule?	BALANC	nonstatement
Where will that leave this Government on minimum service level obligations?	ADEQ	nonstatement
The overview in the explanatory notes makes it clear that the ability to sack workers is a key aspect of the Bill.	RELATE	nonstatement
That is the polar opposite of what was said when a transport strike Bill was listed in the Queenâ€™s Speech in December 2019, when it was stated that workers would not be discriminated against.	REPLIC	nonstatement
Why are the Government now threatening peopleâ€™s livelihoods?	POLIT	nonstatement
How can that be deemed acceptable?	 they should never be allowed to happen without consequences. The Bill makes it clear that such intimidation has no place in the modern workplace.,PHYSICAL	nonstatement
The sacking aspect is the proof that this is nothing to do with minimum cover by ambulance staff, as the Secretary of State likes to tell us.	REPLIC	nonstatement
For fire services, the Secretary of State could also utilise the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, if he felt the desire to do so.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
It is crystal clear that this legislation is not required.	REPLIC	nonstatement
It is an attack on democracy and the right to strike; it will prolong industrial disputes, not resolve them; it will allow individual workers to be targeted through work notices; and it is politically stupid.	JUST	nonstatement
We have to wonder why this Tory Government are looking to antagonise something like 7 million workers across these sectors.	POLIT	nonstatement
The public can see through a Government who partied while clapping the nurses and now threaten them with the sack.	JUST	nonstatement
They should follow the lead of the Scottish Government and get around the negotiating table.	COLLECTIVE	nonstatement
The resolution of the ScotRail dispute has been commended by both the RMT and ASLEF.	RELATE	nonstatement
There are no strikes planned in the health service in Scotland and the pay deal being implemented by the Scottish Government is one that the UK Government should replicate as a starting point when they get around the negotiating table.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
It is outrageous that the Scottish Government, who have been negotiating in good faith with the unions, will now have this legislation foisted upon themâ€”legislation that Westminster could use to force work notices through in Scotland against the wishes of the Scottish Government and that could ruin otherwise good working relationships in Scotland.	LEGAL	nonstatement
Employment law should be devolved to Scotland, but even that would now just be a sticking plaster.	LEGAL	nonstatement

Mr Deputy Speaker (Sir Roger Gale) I call the Chair of the Transport Committee.	COMPL	nonstatement
18:49:00  Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con) It is a pleasure to contribute to this debate as Chair of the Transport Committee, and I will focus my comments on that particular sector.	BALANC	nonstatement
Let me say at the outset that I support the objective behind the Bill.	RELATE	nonstatement
It does not strike me as unreasonable to seek a mechanism whereby the right of a worker to strike, which I have no quibble with, is balanced against the equally important right of an individual to go about their daily life, to travel to work, for healthcare, for education, to visit loved ones or for any of the millions of other reasons why people travel about.	BALANC	nonstatement
It is therefore appropriate to find a mechanism by which those two rights can be reconciled.	ADEQ	nonstatement
There are, however, a number of practical issues that I will put on the record.	ADEQ	nonstatement
I understand that this is framework legislation and that the detail on how it will operate in the transport sector will follow.	POLIT	nonstatement
I was heartened to hear that the consultation on the rail side of transport will be in place before the Bill completes its parliamentary passage.	ADEQ	nonstatement
There are some issues that have to be clarified and resolved before the Bill can properly take effect.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
As has already been alluded to, it is possible in rail, for example, for parts of the system to operate at a minimum level.	ADEQ	nonstatement
One train an hour could run from London to Manchester instead of threeâ€”there are a number of ways to have that reduction in service.	ADEQ	nonstatement
But some parts of the system are binary: a signal box is either open or closed; and in aviation, an air traffic control centre is either open or closed.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
We need clarity on where the minimum level of service will apply.	BALANC	nonstatement
A related point is whether every aviation, railway or bus line and service will have a minimum service or just a percentage of overall capacity.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
There is a trade-off to be made.	POWER	nonstatement
If another line operates nearby, does that mean that both lines have to operate a minimum service, or would one have a more regular service?	JUST	nonstatement
Those are the trade-offs that will have to be made.	BALANC	nonstatement
In the current dispute on the railways, Network Rail and the train operating companies have a degree of flexibility in making decisions on which lines and stations will be open.	BALANC	nonstatement
Will what they have to cover now be specified in the regulations, or will they be left with some discretion?	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Dave Doogan (Angus) (SNP) Will the hon<prd> Member give way?	REPLIC	nonstatement
Iain Stewart If the hon<prd> Gentleman will forgive me, I have only a minute left and many Members wish to speak.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
My last point is about what will be covered by the definition of â€œtransport servicesâ€.	REPLIC	nonstatement
There are the traditional ones that we all assume will be coveredâ€”trains, buses, flights, ferries and the likeâ€”but what about some of the other modes of transport, such as cycle hire or taxi services?	COMPAR	nonstatement
What does the definition encompass?	POLIT	nonstatement
I will ask my Committee, when we meet later this week, if we can usefully contribute to the consultation, but I thought it would be helpful in this part of the debate to set out some of the questions that will have to be addressed as the Bill goes through.	ADEQ	nonstatement

As always, I am grateful to Ministers for taking the time to speak with me directly about Bills in my capacity as Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Unfortunately, in a Westminster Hall debate on Thursday, the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the hon<prd> Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake), referenced our discussion without giving me advance notice.	ADEQ	nonstatement
He said that I was  â€œvery supportive of a minimum service levelâ€.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
â€”[Official Report, 12 January 2023; Vol.	ADR	nonstatement
725, c.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
372WH.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
]  Let me be very clear to the House, to the Minister and to my constituents: I am against the Bill and will vote against it this evening.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
What I said to the Minister was that Iâ€”and, I am sure, many peopleâ€”think it reasonable for there to be a minimum level of service from our emergency services during a period of strike action, and I encouraged him to pursue that via discussion with the relevant services and trade unions, not by threatening them with the prospect of an effective statutory ban on their right to strike.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
When I asked the Minister whether he had sought to achieve that before introducing the legislation, he was unable to fully answer my question.	CREATE	nonstatement
As we have already heard this evening, the rationale for the Bill is therefore in question.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
The Government say that the legislation in place is not effective and that voluntary agreements cannot be sought, but that is not correct.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
Indeed, in signing off the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill and its compliance with the European convention on human rights, even the Government said:  â€œIn the case of other key public services, important factors exist to mitigate the impacts of industrial actionâ€.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
So what has changed?	ADEQ	nonstatement
As we have already heard, section 240 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 makes it a criminal offence and a breach of employment contract to strike if doing so puts someoneâ€™s life in danger or puts them at risk of serious injury.	LEGAL	nonstatement
That is why we have statutory guidance in place across public services, and it is why trade unions put life-and-limb service provision in place when they organise strikes with management.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
On voluntary agreements, in December last year and this month, such agreements have been put in place.	ADEQ	nonstatement
As far as I am awareâ€”from speaking with striking nurses at Southmead Hospital in my constituency, and later with senior managementâ€”there were no problems with those voluntary service arrangements, so the law is in place, voluntary agreements are in place, and there is no rationale for the Bill.	ADEQ	nonstatement
We can therefore only conclude that it is a negotiating tacticâ€”a threatâ€”by the Government.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Lastly, my Committee was disappointed by the lack of time for scrutinising the Bill.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Once again, Ministers have introduced primary legislation with wide-ranging discretionary powers for Ministers without publishing the details of vital secondary legislation in a timely manner.	JUST	nonstatement
That is unacceptable.	REPLIC	nonstatement
It is poor practice for Ministers to bring legislation to the House in that way.	POWER	nonstatement
As the Regulatory Policy Committee confirmed for me today, the Government are obliged to publish an impact assessment so that that Committee can inform the House of the impact of legislation proposed by Ministers.	REPLIC	nonstatement
However, Ministers have not given the Regulatory Policy Committee the time to review the Governmentâ€™s impact assessment and then inform the House about the consequences of the legislation.	REPLIC	nonstatement
So not only do we have a Bill that has no evidence-based rationale for the need to legislate on voluntary agreements, but we have a Government rushing through the legislation without following due process and without drafting it to the standard that this House requires.	ADEQ	nonstatement
It is clearly a rushed threat, it is unacceptable and it shows disregard for the House and the job that we have to do as parliamentarians to ensure that the law is passed effectively.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
To summarise, can the Minister confirm that the Government will publish the statutory instruments and the impact assessment before the Bill finishes its passage through this House?	ADEQ	nonstatement
I politely suggest that he may want to have another go at trying to explain to the House why the Bill is even necessary in the first place.	BALANC	nonstatement
18:57:00  Saqib Bhatti (Meriden) (Con) I stand to speak in favour of the legislation and to commend the Government for taking this difficult but necessary step.	POLIT	nonstatement
Today I want to talk about duty.	ADR	nonstatement
Through this legislation, we on the Conservative Benches are fulfilling our duty to protect our constituents.	JUST	nonstatement
Those on the Labour Benchesâ€”in hock to their trade union mastersâ€”are failing theirs.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Nurses, teachers, firefighters and all the other professions covered in the legislation are true heroes in our society.	RELATE	nonstatement
They carry out a great service to our communities.	ADEQ	nonstatement
We must continue to focus on growing our economy to meet the wage demands of public sector workers, but we must also maintain the independence of pay review bodies precisely so that we can take the politics out of public sector pay.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
The conversation should also be about fairness and balancing the right to strike with the publicâ€™s right to be kept safe.	BALANC	nonstatement
We saw that with the Royal College of Nursing, which maintained a safe level of service.	COLLECTIVE	nonstatement
That just goes to show how selfless and professional those nurses where while exercising their democratic right, and I am grateful to them for protecting the public.	JUST	nonstatement
I certainly hope that, in the next independent pay review, we reach a positive result and avoid future strike action.	COMPL	nonstatement
The concept of minimum service levels is protected in article 11 of the ECHR and is endorsed by the International Labour Organisation.	LEGAL	nonstatement
As we have already heard, this is no different from what is done in Italy, France and Spain.	COMPAR	nonstatement
In that light, I find the position of the Labour party quite astonishing.	REPLIC	nonstatement
We all have a primary duty to protect our constituents and our communities.	BALANC	nonstatement
By opposing the legislation, the Labour party is, in my view, failing in that duty.	POLIT	nonstatement
To be frank, Labour has supported the strikes, whether implicitly or explicitly.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
At best, it has failed to take an appropriate stand against the trade unions; at worst, it is egging them on and relishing the disruption and division being caused.	RELATE	nonstatement
Is that what the modern Labour party stands forâ€”closing down our schools, bringing our country to a standstill and threatening livelihoods?	BALANC	nonstatement
I know it is a new year, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is the same old Labour party.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
We on the Government Benches will not compromise on our fundamental duty.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
We will do all we can to protect our constituents, our communities and our society.	BALANC	nonstatement
That is why I endorse the Bill.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement

Kate Osborne No.	COMPAR	nonstatement
This Government are turning back the clock not just on workersâ€™ rights but on the rights of the vast majority of this country.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
As always, Ministers are only concerned about making money for their cronies and big business.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
My constituents have been in touch with me over the last few days to express how angry and disappointed they are at the Governmentâ€™s handling of these disputes.	BALANC	nonstatement
While I have time, I would rather say what my constituents want me to say than hear what Conservative Members want to say.	JUST	nonstatement
My constituent Robert Best from Boldon emailed me yesterday:  â€œThe Government should be finding ways to help striking workers, rather than remove their right to strike!	RELATE	nonstatement
Right now, refusing to negotiate with workers is the last thing our country needs.	RELATE	nonstatement

Workers need a pay rise, not a P45.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Last week, in a question to the Business Secretary, I referenced the struggles of the Tolpuddle martyrs and the seven men of Jarrowâ€”people who were criminalised 200 years ago for fighting for basic health and safety and pay.	JUST	nonstatement

I will not stop raving on.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
I will not stop supporting workers and the people in my community.	BALANC	nonstatement
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Kevin Hollinrake) I am grateful to the hon<prd> Member for giving way.	JUST	nonstatement
Will she point out where there are any criminal sanctions attached to the proposed legislation?	RIGHTS	nonstatement
As far as I can see, there are absolutely none.	ADEQ	nonstatement
It is important that we do not scaremonger in that way.	REPLIC	nonstatement
Kate Osborne The Governmentâ€™s proposed legislation and the response I just got show the contempt in which they hold working people.	POLIT	nonstatement
The Government do not care about working people.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
They do not care about our communities who are struggling to survive in the face of unaffordable food and energy bills, and struggling to deal with the cost of living crisis and 13 years of cuts by the Conservative party.	JUST	nonstatement
We already have the most restrictive workersâ€™ rights in western Europe, and it is an affront to democracy that this Government are trying to restrict them further.	JUST	nonstatement
Of course, the Government know that the Bill is not workable.	REPLIC	nonstatement
It will be held up in the other place, if it gets that far, and in the courts.	RELATE	nonstatement
They only care about attention-grabbing headlinesâ€”about moving the Overton window so the people of this country will accept more and more restrictions on their rights.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Minimum service levels already exist: our NHS teams ensure that priority calls are dealt with, and teachers ensure that special educational needs children are catered for.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
What we need is for the Government to provide a minimum service level every day.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
We hear daily of workers struggling to cope with current staffing levels.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The Government should be looking at ways to address the NHS staffing crisis, not making it worse.	ADEQ	nonstatement
The Government need to accept that the reason so many sectors are saying â€œenough is enoughâ€ and taking industrial actionâ€”we heard the announcement today that the teaching unions will take action, and I send my solidarity to themâ€”is the Governmentâ€™s failures.	JUST	nonstatement
The firefighters, NHS staff, transport staff and education staff that the Bill targets are the very people who saw us through the pandemic.	RELATE	nonstatement
If the Bill passes, no doubt the Government will eventually seek to apply the legislation to workers in more sectors.	REPLIC	nonstatement
Instead of inflaming the situation, they should start dealing with the causes of increased strike action: low wages, fuel and food poverty, and cuts to public services.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
As I said at the start, it is an act of political violence.	POLIT	nonstatement
The Government should do the right thing for the country and withdraw it.	JUST	nonstatement
19:05:00  Dr Ben Spencer (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con) We have had so much disruption to our critical services in recent years, and I pay tribute to all those working in those sectors.	BALANC	nonstatement
I support minimum service levels for our critical services.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Who could oppose them?	POWER	nonstatement
Well, the Labour party does.	POLIT	nonstatement
It says it is protecting workersâ€™ rights, but does that not ignore the rights of all of those who rely on these key services for their health, their education and their livelihood?	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
We have seen the sad impact on pupils of disruption to education, the extra burden it places on families and schools, and the anxiety that causes parents and students.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
The Childrenâ€™s Commissioner highlighted this weekend that it is the most disadvantaged who face the greatest impact if education is disrupted.	BALANC	nonstatement
I support the right of children to a great education, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	BALANC	nonstatement
It says it is protecting workersâ€™ rights, but that ignores the rights of working families and students if schools close.	BALANC	nonstatement
Minimum service levels should also apply to our ambulance service.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
We all know the challenges our NHS is facing, yet at a time when we need to focus on addressing them, Labour opposes minimum service levels for our ambulance and fire services.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
Does anyone really believe it should be up to intransigent unions to decide whether help arrives?	RELATE	nonstatement
Emergency services should not be a bargaining chip in employment disputes.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Our country cannot be held to ransom by intransigent unions.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
I believe the NHS should be there when we need it, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	BALANC	nonstatement
It says it is protecting workersâ€™ rights, but what about the right to receive care in an emergency?	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The rail strikes are yet another example.	ADEQ	nonstatement
I have been contacted by constituents whose children are unable to get to school, commuters unable to get to work, and patients unable to see their loved ones in hospital or go to appointments.	BALANC	nonstatement

19:08:00  Vicky Foxcroft (Lewisham, Deptford) (Lab) Let me start by declaring an interest: I am a proud member of both Unite the union and GMB and, prior to being elected to this place, I worked for Unite the union for over a decade.	COMPL	nonstatement
Contrary to what some Conservative Members may have us believe, trade unions want their workplaces to thrive.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
They know that a productive workplace needs a happy, motivated workforce.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
They know that, when companies make large profits, they can ask for decent pay rises for their members.	CREATE	nonstatement
When workplaces struggle, they will work with the employer to ensure it survives.	CREATE	nonstatement
We all know how public sector workers kept our country moving during the pandemic.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
They worked night and day to keep us safe, but how does this Government seek to repay them?	RELATE	nonstatement
First, with a derisory pay offer and thenâ€” because the unions have voted to strike, rather than roll over and accept the derisory pay offerâ€”the Prime Minister has resorted to launching a fundamental attack on workersâ€™ freedoms.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
This Bill is unworkable and impractical.	LEGAL	nonstatement
Between 2010 and 2020, France lost almost six times as many days to strikes as the UK, and Spain lost more than twice as many.	COMPAR	nonstatement
Ironically, we already have minimum service levels in place in the UK.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
I remember when I joined a picket line with striking firemen and women, and they told me how they had agreed with their employer that, if there was any fire or any other emergency, they would jump into the fire engines and be straight there.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
None of them wanted to see anyone lose their lives because of their action, which was their last resort.	RELATE	nonstatement
Most worryingly, the Bill does not give any indication of what will constitute a minimum level of service, meaning that the Secretary of State will be able to change that at their discretion.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Having stretched public services and the workforce to breaking point, the Governmentâ€™s solution is to create conditions in which workers can be forced into work and are unable to withhold their labour, no matter what the employee does.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Is that really the kind of Britain of which we want to be partâ€”one in which workersâ€™ freedoms are being restricted to the extent that they could be sacked for standing up for their rights?	POLIT	nonstatement
Chris Loder What would the hon<prd> Lady say to those members of the RMT who decided to come back to work before Christmas because they did not agree with what the union was doing?	RELATE	nonstatement
Vicky Foxcroft That is democracy.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Trade unions are subject to the most vigorous legislation when they are balloting and trade union money is the cleanest money in politics.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Public sector workers are proud of the role they play in society, saving and protecting lives, but they need to be valued and their voices matter.	BALANC	nonstatement
When our NHS workers say they are worried about public health and the NHS, we need to listen, not curtail the right for their voices to be heard.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
The Government could and should have negotiated with the trade unions to get a decent settlement.	RELATE	nonstatement
They need to listen closely to the concerns that workers across the country have been raising.	RELATE	nonstatement

19:13:00  Laura Farris (Newbury) (Con) I would like to accept the invitation of the shadow Deputy Prime Minister, the right hon<prd> Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner), who encouraged us to be respectful in this debate.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
I wish to be so.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
We have heard a lot from the Labour party this evening about how the Bill is an act of political violence and an attack on the fundamental freedom of working people, but we have not heard an answer to the fundamental question that the legislation poses: do the British people have a right set out in statute to a basic safety and security guarantee during periods of strike?	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Let us start with the law.	POLIT	nonstatement
Joanna Cherry The hon<prd> Lady asks whether any of us on the Opposition Benches care about fundamental safety levels, and yes we do.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
She asked whether we would support legislating, but legislation already exists.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
On article 11, she knows as well as I do that the measures have to be â€œnecessaryâ€.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
The Governmentâ€™s own memo with the last legislation said that the measures were not necessary in relation to the health service, education and fire and rescue.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Laura Farris I thank the hon<prd> and learned Lady for her point, and I will assist her, because I was coming on to that point.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The article 11 right may be restricted for two reasonsâ€”if the restriction is necessary, yes, and proportionate.	LEGAL	nonstatement
The International Labour Organisation, of which the United Kingdom is a founding member, recognises that maintaining a minimum level of service provision can be both when it comes to essential services.	BALANC	nonstatement
Its committee on freedom of association has expressly set out the two circumstances in which it may be appropriate: where strike action would pose a risk to life, safety or health; or where the service is not essential in the strict sense of the word, but where repeated strikes would bring a very important sector to a standstill.	BALANC	nonstatement
Chris Stephens The ILO also says, does it not, that the minimum service level has to be agreed by an independent arbiter if there is a dispute, which is not in the Bill, and that there should not be a dismissal, which is in the Bill?	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Laura Farris I am grateful to both SNP Members for their interventions.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
I am coming on to those points, so I will make a tiny bit of progress, if I may.	BALANC	nonstatement
On the point raised by the hon<prd> and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry), we already know that transport and education meet the ILOâ€™s test, because the ILO told the United Kingdom that in its response to the challenge to the Trade Union Act 2016 submitted by the TUC in 2015.	LEGAL	nonstatement
In its response, the ILO committee of expertsâ€”Members can look it up; it is on the websiteâ€”said that in relation to transport and education  â€œrecourse might be had to negotiated minimum standards for these sectors as appropriateâ€.	BALANC	nonstatement
We also know that many comparable countries take a much tougher line than the Government are proposing.	JUST	nonstatement
In the United States, to give one example, 38 out of 50 states ban public sector strikes altogether.	BALANC	nonstatement
Barry Gardiner (Brent North) (Lab) The hon<prd> Lady is presenting a reasoned case, but she knows, and she has just used the word, that these things should be negotiated.	JUST	nonstatement
The measures in this Bill are by fiat of the Secretary of State.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Laura Farris I thank the hon<prd> Gentleman for his point.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
I am coming to all these things, so if he will give me a moment, I will continue.	POLIT	nonstatement
In the United States, 38 out of 50 states have an outright ban on public sector strikes, including New York.	COMPAR	nonstatement
Other states, such as Canada, Australia, Italy and Spain, all have embedded in statute minimum service levels that apply to important public services, and those services are often drawn much more widely than the Government are proposing.	COMPAR	nonstatement
They include waste collection, postal services, broadcast services, the administration of justice, water distribution and energy supply.	REPLIC	nonstatement
I pick out those states not as random examples, but because every single one is a member of the International Labour Organisation.	LEGAL	nonstatement
They are bound by exactly the same rules as us, and they are among our closest comparators around the world.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Even more importantly, the International Labour Organisation has adjudicated all their statutory minimum service levels, and a 2019 publication from the ILO in Geneva commented:  â€œThese examples illustrate the wide diversity of approach that ILO member states have adopted to address the challenges posed by industrial disputes in essential servicesâ€.	BALANC	nonstatement
Minimum service levels  â€œsupported by the ILOâ€™s supervisory organs, exist to manage the balancing act between these necessary restrictions and the individual workerâ€™s fundamental labour rightsâ€.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
I have not heard a single Member of Parliament tonight explain to me why the ILO is wrong or why the Government are striking the wrong balance when they have a mandate for what they are doing.	JUST	nonstatement
Sam Tarry (Ilford South) (Lab) For example, the ILO imposes restraints on the circumstances in which such powers can be used, which is the antithesis of the Governmentâ€™s blank cheque approach.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Laura Farris With respect to the hon<prd> Gentleman, I take the opposite position.	REPLIC	nonstatement
The United States has an outright ban on public service strikes in 38 states.	COMPAR	nonstatement
In December, President Biden made his most recent intervention in union rights when he signed legislation that imposed an outright ban on a national railroad strike.	ADEQ	nonstatement

The Secretary of State took great joy in reading out how much hon<prd> Members receive from trade unions, which is, as my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Vicky Foxcroft) said, the cleanest money in politics.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement

In the short time that I have, I will talk about the Bill.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
It is dishonest; it is an insult to trade unions, which are the aspirational vehicle of the working class; and it is an insult to Parliament and parliamentary procedures.	JUST	nonstatement
Most of the detail of the Bill is missing and the Government have said that they will add it laterâ€”that is not how we are supposed to do politics or make legislation.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
It allows the Government to amend and revoke any future legislation passed in this Session, so what is the point of Parliament?	ADEQ	nonstatement
No matter what we say or pass, the Government can turn around and say, â€œWe want to change it,â€ or, â€œWe want to revoke it.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
â€ That is against what every single Member of Parliament has been elected to do.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement

The sweeping Henry VIII powers in the Bill, enabling Ministers to amend, repeal or revoke primary legislation not yet passed, should chill the heart of any democrat.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
It is ironic that a Government so keen to turn their back on Europe lean so heavily on their excuse, â€œBut that is what other countries doâ€.	COMPAR	nonstatement
It is also deeply disingenuous, and as Unison has rightly pointed out, countries being cherry-picked by the Government, such as Italy and France, come to voluntary agreements through collaborative processes and have far less restrictive measures in place than we currently see in the UK.

Strikes are not the cause of the problems we face here; they are a symptom of the deep-rooted damage that has been done to our public service by this Government.	RELATE	nonstatement
The fact is that nobody downs tools without very good cause, especially during a cost of living crisis.	COLLECTIVE	nonstatement
Whatever motivation workers may have, they are under attack on all fronts by this Government, and I commend the unions for taking action to protect their members.	JUST	nonstatement
If the Government continue to be determined to go down this destructive path, further damaging industrial relations, they must devolve employment law now, so that the Scottish Government have the powers they need to protect the rights of the people of Scotland from the damage of this Government.

19:32:00  Mr Gagan Mohindra (South West Hertfordshire) (Con) May I first welcome you to your place, Mr Deputy Speaker?	COMPL	nonstatement
I place on record my thanks to all public sector workers for the excellent work they have doneâ€”not just during the pandemic, but for many years prior to it.	ADEQ	nonstatement
As we all know, the country is facing a difficult period of economic hardship.	CREATE	nonstatement
Yes, it is partly because of the war in Ukraine, and yes, it is partly because of our active response in the fight against the pandemic, but we need to be conscious that we are here to support workers, and not all workers are members of unions.	JUST	nonstatement
As many Members will knowâ€”I have said this in this place beforeâ€”while I represent quite a lovely constituency, public transport very much runs north and south, and when there are rail strikes, my constituents can get around only with extreme difficulty.	BALANC	nonstatement
While that may not necessarily hurt those who have the ability to access a car or, in extremis, pay for a little cab, those who we should be supporting the most are actually the ones most affected by thisâ€”the ones who are not able to use the bus to send their kids off to school or to get to their GP surgery for a doctorâ€™s appointment.	BALANC	nonstatement
Reference has been made to the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, which I know has had a really tough time over many years.	ADEQ	nonstatement
I would like to place on record my thanks that it was not one of the bodies that had a strike over recent weeks.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Unfortunately, I have had to use its services over the last few weeks and months, and I know that it is literally saving lives in doing the excellent work it does in very difficult circumstances.	ADEQ	nonstatement
One of the things I want to make the public aware of is that, post pandemic, we have adapted the way we work.	RELATE	nonstatement
Yes, we are very supportive of people such as rail workers, but the general population will adapt.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
I am a firm believer that we should be encouraging people to get back to work, which may mean commuting to London, as it does for a lot of my constituents.	BALANC	nonstatement
However, if that proves too difficult, they will just turn around and say, â€œActually, weâ€™ve already adapted, post pandemic, to working from homeâ€.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
That means we will hollow out the urban areas of our country such as central London, where instead of a vibrant high street, as we have had with Victoria Street, we will very quickly have high street retailers, such as the Pret A Mangers of the world, closing up shop because they do not have the footfall to support them.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Reference has been made to international comparisons.	COMPAR	nonstatement
I for one think we have got the balance right with our support for workers, but also, counter to that, for wealth creators.	BALANC	nonstatement
As someone who comes from a small and medium-sized enterprise background, I know that I was fully reliant on one, two or three workers in, in my case, a furniture retail shop, to make sure the business could run, and I could not have done it without them.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
They were not part of a union, but 80% of our economy is reliant on SMEs, so while unions are excellent in the work they do for large public sector bodies, other workers out there are not members of a union.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Mr Deputy Speaker Order.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
19:36:00  Sarah Owen (Luton North) (Lab) I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Membersâ€™ Financial Interests and declare that I am proudly a trade union member, as will be no surprise to anybody.	POLIT	nonstatement
I will save the Secretary of State, who is no longer in his place, time and say that the donation to me three years ago was actually my final monthâ€™s salary from the GMB.	ADEQ	nonstatement
I would rather have clean donations from trade unions any day over anything that the Conservative party receives from non-doms.	ADEQ	nonstatement
The attacks on the rights and freedoms of our constituents are only becoming more apparent.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
We are all desperate for our public services to be stronger, faster, more effective and cost-efficient, but it is not the fault of the selfless and hard-working key workers in our health, rail and teaching sectors that public services are in the skeletal state they are or that nurses are having to use food banks.	RELATE	nonstatement
It is the fault of 13 years of Tory Governments.	POWER	nonstatement
As for many others in this Chamber, the prosperity of public services and their workforce is personal for me.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
I was care worker, I worked in the fire brigade and I was a healthcare assistant doing shifts in hospitals.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
I have also been a trade union member for nearly 20 years, and I have been a trade union officer working on pro-manufacturing campaigns, bereavement leave for foster carers, stopping the abuse of agency workers, training airport staff and ensuring survivors of domestic abuse are safe at work.	JUST	nonstatement
I say this not because it is particularly extraordinary, but because this is all in a dayâ€™s work for trade unionists, and Conservative Members should bear that in mind while they denigrate the work of trade unions.	BALANC	nonstatement
This is not just political; it is also personal.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
My partner works in education, while my father was a firefighter and my mother was a nurse.	BALANC	nonstatement
They took great pride in their work, and so they should.	POLIT	nonstatement
When we face crises personally or nationally, it is these workers we rely on to keep us safe, to heal us, and to protect our homes and our loved ones.	BALANC	nonstatement
Why then are this Government determined to punish those workers with real-terms pay cuts, job losses, worse terms and uncertain futures, yet still reward bankers with unlimited bonuses?	JUST	nonstatement
Not only are British public service workers seeing their pay declining or their jobs cut, they are now told that they cannot speak up about it.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
The message to public sector heroes from this Bill is: â€œPut up and shut upâ€.	POLIT	nonstatement
Unfortunately for this Government, that is not the spirit of this country or of the party of these Benches.	REPLIC	nonstatement
Our constituents know the value of their work, and they know the dignity they deserve.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
When it comes to civil liberties, oh, the Conservatives talk a good game about freedom of speech, but on the basic rights to strike and to protest, this Governmentâ€”one of the most extreme Tory Governmentsâ€”are on the wrong side every time.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
They fight for the rights of holocaust deniers, climate change sceptics, and out-and-out misogynists to say whatever they like online, in an effort to appear anti-woke and pro-freedom of speech, yet when it comes to the freedoms of nurses, teachers, doctors, paramedics, firefighters, support staff and healthcare assistants, the Conservatives are not on their side, and they do not want them to have the same freedoms as everyone else.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Ordinary working people such as the ones Ministers are now trying to gag fought for our rightsâ€”the right to maternity leave and bank holidays, the right to be safe at work and have equal pay, and the right to remove our labour.	JUST	nonstatement
The right for people to have their voices heard when those in power are not listening.	JUST	nonstatement
Time and again, the Tories show that they are on the wrong side.	POLIT	nonstatement
All they have to do is listen and negotiate.	RELATE	nonstatement
They are the reason why people need strong trade unions and a Labour Government, because the Tories will never be on the side of working people.	BALANC	nonstatement
I will always be on the side of working people, and I will vote against the Bill today.	BALANC	nonstatement
19:40:00  Ruth Edwards (Rushcliffe) (Con) That is what we are talking about.	ADEQ	nonstatement
The Bill is not about views on the rights and wrongs of the current strikes.	JUST	nonstatement
I deeply value the work of nurses, teachers, firefighters, ambulance drivers and rail staff across Rushcliffe and the country, and of course they should have the right to withdraw their labour.	RELATE	nonstatement
The Bill is about how they can do so safely.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement

Justin Madders I start by referring to my entry in the Register of Membersâ€™ Financial Interests, as I have done throughout the passage of the Bill.	COMPL	nonstatement
I thank Members in all parts of the House for their valuable contributions throughout the passage of the Bill to date, and in particular my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Llanelli (Dame Nia Griffith) for her assistance in taking the Bill through Committee, and the other members of the Public Bill Committee for providing substantial debate and scrutiny.	BALANC	nonstatement
It is therefore important that we get the detail right.	BALANC	nonstatement
The amendments being put forward by the Government directly demonstrate our commitment to full and comprehensive consultation on the detail of the plan to make work pay.	CREATE	nonstatement
On 4 March, we published five consultation responses relating to key areas of the Bill.	COURTS	nonstatement
That package represents the first phase of formal public consultations on how best to put our plans into practice.	POLIT	nonstatement
We have also undertaken extensive engagement with more than 150 stakeholder organisations, in addition to the formal consultations.	REPLIC	nonstatement
We have made great efforts to listen to the range of views from businesses, trade unions, representative organisations, civil society and others.	JUST	nonstatement
The insights gained have been invaluable in informing the amendments to ensure the Bill works in practice, both for workers and for businesses of all sizes across the whole country.	BALANC	nonstatement
The amendments will strengthen the Bill, providing further detail and clarity on measures and ensuring such measures can be implemented in a straightforward way.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
I turn to the detail of the amendments.	CREATE	nonstatement
What is the answer?	JUST	nonstatement
Justin Madders The answer is in the Departmentâ€™s press release, which cites Simon Deakin, professor of law at the University of Cambridge, no less.	ADEQ	nonstatement
He has said:  I am sure that the right hon<prd> Member wants to see that happen.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Liam Byrne (Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North) (Lab) The Minister will have seen the appalling evidence that the Business and Trade Committee took from McDonaldâ€™s, where the BBC investigation exposed allegations from hundreds of young workers who were suffering harassment, and even allegations from one worker of managers soliciting them for sex in return for scheduling shifts.	POWER	nonstatement
Justin Madders I thank the Chairman of the Select Committee for his question.	BALANC	nonstatement
We are aiming to work on this once the Bill has passed this stage, and consultation will take place in due course.	POLIT	nonstatement
I have to say that the chuntering from those on the Conservative Benches really shows how they fail to appreciate the power imbalance that there is in some workplaces and the exploitation and harassment that arise from that.	POWER	nonstatement
Many agency workers have a preference for guaranteed hours, according to survey evidence.	POWER	nonstatement
We know that 55% of agency workers requested a permanent contract with their hirer between January 2019 and September 2020, according to the Department for Business and Tradeâ€™s agency worker survey.	JUST	nonstatement
Given the important role that agency work plays in businesses and public services, we recognise the need to work with the recruitment sector, employers and trade unions to design detailed provisions for regulations that workâ€”that is,  The Government have also tabled amendments in relation to dismissal and redundancy practices.	BALANC	nonstatement
Sir Ashley Fox (Bridgwater) (Con) I had the good fortune to serve with the Minister for 21 sessions in Committee, and at the end of that we had a Bill 192 pages long.	BALANC	nonstatement
We now have 270 pages of amendments, most of which come from the Government.	BALANC	nonstatement
Why are they tabling so many amendments and giving them just two daysâ€™ scrutiny?	JUST	nonstatement
Are these just more union demands?	JUST	nonstatement
Justin Madders I have literally just explained how we have been consulting with businesses and trade unions and put down amendments as a result.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Of course, if the hon<prd> Member is concerned about the length of the amendment paper, he can withdraw his own amendment, which we will no doubt be debating later on.	LEGAL	nonstatement
We are tabling some technical amendments to clause 21 on unfair dismissal that will update cross-references in other legislation to â€œthe sumâ€, which is the existing cap on the compensation that can be awarded by an employment tribunal in most unfair dismissal cases.	JUST	nonstatement
13:45:00 We have listened to feedback from business on the clause as introduced, which required consultation whenever 20 or more redundancies were proposed to be made across an employerâ€™s organisation.	POWER	nonstatement
Businesses told us that this would have put them in a constant state of consultation, The amendment means that collective redundancy obligations will be triggered where 20 or more redundancies are proposed at one establishment, in line with the existing law, or the number of proposed redundancies across the organisation meets a certain threshold.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The Government will set this threshold out in due course via secondary legislation.	CREATE	nonstatement
This could be a proportion of employees in a business, a suitable number of employees across a business, or some other threshold proposed through detailed consultation.	RELATE	nonstatement
Employers will also be required to notify the Government of redundancies that meet the threshold set in secondary legislation.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
New clause 34 will therefore double the protective award an employment tribunal can make from 90 to 180 days.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
We consulted on this and other matters from October to December 2024, and after listening carefully to a range of responses from businesses and employee representatives, we have concluded that the maximum period of the protective award an employment tribunal can make should be raised from 90 to 180 days.	RELATE	nonstatement
This is on top of changes that the Government have already made.	ADEQ	nonstatement
From 20 January this year, employment tribunals have had the ability to uplift the protective award by up to 25% where an employer unreasonably failed to follow the code of practice on dismissal and re-engagement.	ADEQ	nonstatement
We recognise that responsible employers up and down the country already go further than their current obligations to collectively consult and will continue to do so.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The Government are also tabling amendments in relation to the Billâ€™s provisions on flexible working and dismissal during pregnancy.	COLLECTIVE	nonstatement
Clause 22 adds a new power to make provisions for non-redundancy dismissals during or after the protected period of pregnancy.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The amendments will add supplementary provisions to this power.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
We will work with stakeholders on how to exercise these powers in regulations.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
Amendment 79 to clause 7 proposes that the flexible working measures in the Bill be added to those provisions in scope of section 202 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
That means that the security servicesâ€”MI5, GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Serviceâ€”will be exempt from disclosing any information related to flexible working requests if, in the opinion of a Minister, it would be contrary to national security.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
In those instances, the employer would not need to disclose the reasons for refusing a request.	COMPL	nonstatement
The Government are moving amendments on statutory sick pay.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
We launched a public consultation that asked employers, employees, trade unions, stakeholders and members of the public what percentage rate that should be.	BALANC	nonstatement
Todayâ€™s amendments will set the rate of statutory sick pay at 80% of an employeeâ€™s normal weekly earnings or the flat rateâ€”whichever is lower.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Consequently, we will remove the previously proposed power for the Secretary of State to prescribe the percentage rate in secondary legislation.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
However, Ministers will still be able to use the existing power in section 157 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to substitute a different provision as to the weekly flat rate of SSP, or the percentage rate of the employeeâ€™s weekly earnings, depending on which is lower.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The amendments also amend the weekly flat rate to Â£118<prd>75, as agreed by Parliament as part of its annual uprating exercise.	COMPL	nonstatement
The Government are moving amendments that will add two new provisions into part 2 of the Bill.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
Analysis conducted by the Resolution Foundation found that 900,000 workers reported that they had no paid holiday despite that being a day one entitlement.	ADEQ	nonstatement
New clause 35 will create a new duty in the Working Time Regulations 1998 for employers to retain records relating to holiday pay and annual leave for six years.	BALANC	nonstatement
Sir Alec Shelbrooke (Wetherby and Easingwold) (Con) I apologise if the Minister has moved on a bit; I was just waiting to hear what he said.	REPLIC	nonstatement
Justin Madders I am grateful to the right hon<prd> Member for raising this important point.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
It was touched on in Committee, but there are not any amendments dealing with that specific issue today.	POLIT	nonstatement
Returning to holiday pay, where an employer does not keep adequate records, a Fair Work Agency enforcement officer may seek a labour market enforcement undertaking from the employer to ensure future compliance.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
Where the employer refuses to give a labour market enforcement undertaking, or fails to comply with one, the FWA enforcement officer may apply to the appropriate court for a labour market enforcement order.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
Chris Law (Dundee Central) (SNP) I apologise to the Minister because he has moved on, but I want to come back to the new level of statutory sick pay, which is Â£118<prd>75 or 80% of an employeeâ€™s weekly earnings.	CREATE	nonstatement
An employee with weekly earnings of Â£125 would at present get Â£116<prd>75, but under the new model, they would receive only Â£100.	COMPAR	nonstatement
Is that correct?	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
Justin Madders Yes, but the hon<prd> Member forgets the fact that we are removing the waiting days.	COMPAR	nonstatement
With the provisions on the lower earnings limit going, 1<prd>3 million people will be accessing statutory sick pay.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Of course, it is something that we will always continue to review.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Moving on to umbrella companies, we are aware of non-compliance in this market, where umbrella companies can be responsible for denying employment rights to those who work through them.	DETER	nonstatement
New clause 36 will allow for the regulation of umbrella companies and for enforcement by the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, and subsequently the Fair Work Agency.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
The specific requirements on umbrella companies will be set out in the relevant regulations, which set out the minimum standards of conduct for employment agencies and employment businesses.	CREATE	nonstatement
We will consult before amending these regulations, and we are committed to working with the sector to ensure that future regulation works effectively for umbrella companies.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
The Government are moving a range of amendments in relation to part 3 of the Bill, which covers the adult social care negotiating body and the school support staff negotiating body.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
On the SSSNB, the Government are moving two technical amendments to correct incorrect cross-references.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
The body is an important part of delivering both the Governmentâ€™s â€œPlan to Make Work Payâ€ and our opportunity mission.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
The Government will today commit to consult in the summer on whether agency workers should be brought into scope of the SSSNB in future legislation to support those missions.	POWER	nonstatement
Munira Wilson (Twickenham) (LD) Could the Minister clarify for the House whether the provisions on the school support staff negotiating body will provide a ceiling as well as a floor on pay, or will it just be a floor?	BALANC	nonstatement
There are certainly a number of school and academy leaders who say they want to pay above what the Government might recommend for support staff and that this may limit them from doing so.	RELATE	nonstatement
Justin Madders That was debated in detail in Committee.	CREATE	nonstatement
My understanding is that there will be a floor, but there will not be a ceiling.	ADEQ	nonstatement
If I am wrong about that, I will come back to that.	POLIT	nonstatement
Amendments to the adult social care negotiating body provisions will remove clause 42, thereby removing the power to make stand-alone enforcement provision in respect of the agreements reached by negotiating body.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
Enforcement of pay terms under agreements will instead be in the remit of the new Fair Work Agency under schedule 4.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
Wendy Morton (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con) The Minister is rattling off a whole list of amendments that appear to have come after the legislation has gone through Committee.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Justin Madders The reason why we are putting so many amendments down is because we have been consulting and working with businesses, and that is why we have so much to say today.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Sir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con) In that consultation, how many small businesses expressed their support for the Bill?	ADEQ	nonstatement
Justin Madders I refer the right hon<prd> Member to our departmental press release, where at least half a dozen business representatives and businesses have expressed support, and of course, there are many more businesses out there.	ADEQ	nonstatement
Indeed, I visited one only recently that supported the Bill.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Alison Griffiths (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con) Would the Minister be kind enough to name one of those businesses on the press release?	RELATE	nonstatement
[Interruption.	CREATE	nonstatement

Justin Madders There is the Co-opâ€”quite a big businessâ€”Richer Sounds, Centrica and the British Chambers of Commerce.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
These are not bit-part players at all, are they?	JUST	nonstatement
New clause 38 seeks to ensure that agency workers in the adult social care sector who do not have a â€œworkerâ€™s contractâ€, within the meaning of employment legislation, would nevertheless be able to bring a claim in the employment tribunals or in civil proceedings where a fair pay agreement has been breached.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
It does that by deeming a contract to exist for this purpose between the worker and the party that pays them.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
New clause 37 and associated amendments will enable the Scottish and Welsh Ministers to establish their own separate negotiating bodies and associated framework, and to enable their negotiating bodies and the resulting agreements to cover social care workers in both adult and childrenâ€™s social care.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
Care policy, funding and commissioning is delivered together in both Wales and Scotland.	LEGAL	nonstatement
In England, the two workforces, and therefore the policies and delivery, are distinct.	RELATE	nonstatement

The Government recognise the important points raised by both hon<prd> Friends, and the serious impact that domestic abuse has on society, particularly on women and girls.	JUST	nonstatement
We strongly encourage employers to support staff who experience domestic abuse.	RELATE	nonstatement
The Government have committed to halving violence against women and girls in a decade.	ADEQ	nonstatement
I have met the Minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Birmingham Yardley (Jess Phillips), who is, as the House knows, a dedicated and respected campaigner on those issues.	REPLIC	nonstatement
I have also spoken to several Members about their concerns, including my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Gloucester (Alex McIntyre), whose private Memberâ€™s Billâ€”the Domestic Abuse (Safe Leave) Billâ€”has been given its First Reading; my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Lowestoft; and the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Alex Davies-Jones).	JUST	nonstatement
Members shared many powerful stories from their constituents.	BALANC	nonstatement
Every part of Government will need to contribute towards our ambition.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Jerome Mayhew (Broadland and Fakenham) (Con) When my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Alison Griffiths) asked a moment ago which businesses support the Bill, the Minister mentioned the British Chambers of Commerce.	BALANC	nonstatement
I have just visited its website, which states:  â€œThe British Chambers of Commerce has used an evidence session on the Employment Rights Bill to highlight businessesâ€™ serious concerns about the legislation and the speed and detail of consultation.	COMPL	nonstatement
â€  Will the Minister withdraw his comment?	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Justin Madders I am glad that the hon<prd> Member has access to the internet.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
I direct him to the Departmentâ€™s webpage, where he will see that Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said:  â€œThere is much here to welcome as sensible moves that will help ensure that employment works for both the business and the individualâ€.	RELATE	nonstatement
That was in response to the amendments, so it is a much more up-to-date comment than the one the hon<prd> Member mentioned.	REPLIC	nonstatement
Returning to the important issue of violence against women and girls, it is incumbent on every part of Government to work together to tackle violence against women and girls.	REPLIC	nonstatement
That is not a task for a single Department or Minister.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
The Government are steadfastly committed to delivering our manifesto commitment to halving violence against women and girls, and we will publish a cross-Government strategy shortly.	JUST	nonstatement
I intend to work with colleagues to ensure that our Department does its bit in that respect.	JUST	nonstatement
I also take this opportunity to note the amendments tabled by my right hon<prd> Friend the Member for Sheffield Heeley (Louise Haigh) and the hon<prd> Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran) on non-disclosure agreements.	BALANC	nonstatement
I have met advocates on that issue and I understand the significant problems that they have highlighted in relation to the misuse of non-disclosure agreements in some circumstances.	ADR	nonstatement

Nothing that has come from Labour Members has given any consideration to the absolutely correct concerns that the shadow Minister, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith), raised in his opening remarks.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Even the Governmentâ€™s own impact assessment, which Opposition Members have mentioned on a number of occasions, concedes that business will face a staggering Â£5 billion in additional costs: an economic straitjacket that will choke innovation and job creation.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Labour Members seem to have failed to realise that being pro-business, as the Conservatives are, is being pro-worker, because if businesses do not exist there will be no one to employ workers.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
In my constituency alone we have over 5,000 businesses, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Many of them operate in the education, retail and hospitality sectors, which rely on flexibility to survive, Lincoln Jopp (Spelthorne) (Con) Gregory Stafford My hon<prd> Friend makes a good point.	BALANC	nonstatement
I think of the University for the Creative Arts students who rely on flexible work and the NHS paramedic in Farnham picking up extra shifts at the Nelson Arms, as I mentioned earlier.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
UKHospitality has been clear that for 90% of workers on zero-hours contracts, that is their preference.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
The sector relies on these contracts to manage fluctuating demand, and removing that flexibility could devastate those businesses and lead to job losses.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
There is no job security for those who do not have a job.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement

We have all felt the effects of a system that has left so many behind: flatlined wages, insecure work and falling living standards.	COLLECTIVE	nonstatement
Diolch yn fawr.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Alison Bennett (Mid Sussex) (LD) Carers UK estimates that the value to the economy of carers being able to work is Â£5<prd>3 billion.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
When I have met major blue-chip employers such as Centrica and HSBC, and their employees who have benefited from those corporationsâ€™ carers policies, The 2<prd>8 million people who juggle a job and caring responsibilities are going above and beyond to care for those they love while also contributing to our economy.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
We must acknowledge their work with a fair deal for them.	RELATE	nonstatement
I know that this is something the carers in my constituency deserve.	JUST	nonstatement
They deserve better.	JUST	nonstatement
We must be adaptable to the changing needs of our population while also seeing the benefits.	BALANC	nonstatement
This really can be a win-win.	BALANC	nonstatement
We know that being a carer makes people much more likely to fall into poverty.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Carers UKâ€™s research also tells us that almost half of all those who left employment early to fulfil a caring responsibility say that they would have stayed in employment longer, had carerâ€™s leave on a paid basis existed.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
Mrs Russell I need to highlight to the House that I am a member of the Community and USDAW trade unions, and I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Membersâ€™ Financial Interests.	BALANC	nonstatement
I would like to speak to various bits of this legislation today.	ENFORCE	nonstatement
There is so much in it, and I know that so many of us on the Government Back Benches are really pleased with what we are bringing forward.	REPLIC	nonstatement
The first part of the legislation that I want to address is clause 22, which will bring forward in future legislation more protections for women who are pregnant, on maternity leave and in the period immediately following their maternity leave.	ADEQ	nonstatement
I have spent the past 13 years representing large numbers of women who were either made redundant while pregnant, on maternity leave or trying to come back from maternity leave, or whose employer suddenly woke up one morning and decided that they were underperforming, often within 24 hours of their announcing their pregnancy.	COLLECT	nonstatement
I had a client who had been headhunted and brought into the company, was totally stellar, doing incredibly well and got promoted, but then announced her pregnancy and within a week she was on a performance plan.	COLLECTIVE	nonstatement
HR explained to her that because they were, you know, kind and did not want to do that to her while she was pregnant, they were very generously offering her a settlement agreement so that she did not have to go through that.	ADR	nonstatement
Lots of perfectly decent people do not understand why they are losing their jobs, and it is because they are pregnant.	ECONOMIC	nonstatement
Pregnant Then Screwed found that 12<prd>3% of women who have had a baby have either been sacked, constructively dismissed or made redundant while pregnant, on maternity leave or within a year of their maternity leave ending.	ADR	nonstatement
Lola McEvoy My hon<prd> Friend, who has great expertise in this area, is making an eloquent speech.	RIGHTS	nonstatement
The second element I like in the legislation is the improvements to the right to request flexible working.	JUST	nonstatement
Those on the Conservative Benches have questioned why we would do this.	JUST	nonstatement
Conservative Members have talked a lot about clause 17 and the third-party harassment elements, and it is worth getting into some of the detail.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
The defence for an employer for failing to protect their staff from third-party harassment is taking all reasonable steps to prevent that harassment from occurring.	PHYSICAL	nonstatement
Employment tribunals have been interpreting the meaning of â€œreasonableâ€ for a long time, and in a discrimination claim there is essentially a three-part judiciary: a judge with legal experience, someone with employer experience, and someone with employee experienceâ€”sometimes from a trade union, but sometimes from elsewhere.	CREATE	nonstatement
Wera Hobhouse The hon<prd> Member is speaking powerfully.	AUTONOMY	nonstatement
Mrs Russell I completely and utterly agree with the hon<prd> Member.	BALANC	nonstatement
Actually, a lot of what is coming from Conservative Members is scaremongering.	ADEQ	nonstatement
