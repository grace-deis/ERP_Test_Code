However, we also need to maintain a reasonable balance between the ability of workers to strike and the rights of the public, who work hard and expect the essential services that they pay for to be there when they need them. We must be able to have confidence that when strikes occur, people’s lives and livelihoods are not put at undue risk. As has become clear from recent industrial action, that is not always the case, so we need a safety net in place to ensure that the public do not become collateral damage.	Conservative Party	Conservatives
The Bill will ensure that we protect the ability of workers to take industrial action, but that we also protect the public from disproportionate disruption to their daily lives and that, to put it simply, one person’s right to strike does not infringe on someone else’s right to life and limb.	Conservatives	Conservatives
So we clearly cannot continue to rely on voluntary arrangements to ensure the safety of the people we represent.	Conservative Party	Conservatives
Employers will be required to consult the union on the number of workers to be identified in the work notice and the work to be undertaken, and have regard to the union’s views before issuing that work notice.	Conservatives	Conservatives
The legislation simply brings us into line, as my hon. Friend just said, with many other modern European nations, such as Spain, Italy, France and Ireland.	Conservatives	Conservatives
It is the minimal standards that the public needs.	Conservatives	Conservatives
We are mindful of and thankful for the contribution of public service workers in this country, but where unions insist on disproportionate and sometimes plain unsafe levels of industrial action without informing the NHS, for example, and others, we must take the necessary steps to protect the public.	Conservatives	Conservatives
Not only is this legislation a vindictive assault on the basic freedoms of British working people, but it is as empty of detail as it is full of holes.	Labour Party	Labour
If the Secretary of State for Transport mandates that 50% of trains need to run on strike days, he knows that Network Rail will mandate that all signal operators need to work, because signals are needed even if just two trains are running. How can the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy say this Bill does not remove their right to strike?	Conservative Party	Labour
At the end of the day, the Government have a responsibility to ensure that certain levels of service are provided in key sectors and in our public services, and rightly so.	Conservatives	Conservatives
It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, our great country and our economy are put at risk by strike action.	Conservatives	Conservatives
It also seems that this legislation is in breach of article 11 of the European convention on human rights, especially with regard to proportionate action.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	Scottish National Party
Despite what the Secretary of State says, it is also clear that this legislation will allow employers to target those they think are part of an awkward squad.	Labour Party	Scottish National Party
The objective of the Bill is absolutely right: we have to balance the right to strike with the right of people to go about their way of life.	Conservative Party	Conservatives
The Government should be negotiating, not legislating.	Labour	Labour

The Opposition will have to say why all those comparable states, which go much further than us, are somehow acting lawfully, yet we are not.	Labour Party	Conservatives

This is a landmark Bill that, once implemented, will represent the biggest upgrade in employment rights for a generation. 	Labour Party	Labour
regulations that achieve the policy objective of extending rights to agency workers without unintended consequences for employment agencies and hirers—and we will work on that in due course.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
They ensure that, once the provisions of the Bill that make unfair dismissal a day one right come into force, the automatic unfair dismissal protections from unscrupulous fire and rehire practices will apply once the employee starts work	Labour Party	Labour Party
This brings the provision in line with other changes to unfair dismissal.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
 This will happen after we have consulted, ensuring that it balances the needs of a growing business with the interests of employees.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
 It was a Labour party commitment to launch an Employment Rights Bill within 100 days of taking office, and I am proud that we have delivered on that commitment and that we have this Bill here today.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
It will enable those regulations to apply to section 49 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 in order to prevent employers from trying to contract out of their new record keeping obligations.	Labour Party	Labour Party

The disability employment gap stands at 30% and countless disabled workers end up out of work because their employers refuse to make simple changes that would help them to do their jobs.	UK Government	Labour Party
Does the Minister agree that the default right to flexible working in Labour’s Employment Rights Bill will help many disabled workers to keep the jobs they love? What else can the Minister’s Department do to help more disabled people to find and keep work?	Conservative Party	Labour Party
With the increase in conditions that can be variable over time, the flexible working right will help people.	Labour Party	UK Government
They will ensure that the framework functions effectively and delivers on our commitment to modernise working practices.	Labour Party	Labour Party
These amendments will streamline the recognition process, reduce opportunities for unfair practices to occur, and ensure that unions that seek recognition have a fair and transparent statutory route to enable them to do so.	Labour Party	Labour Party

That is fair for workers and businesses.	Labour Party	Labour Party
I am sure that my hon. Friend the shadow Minister does understand it. Does he agree that that is fundamental to understanding why the balance of this legislation is wrong?	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
I have two amendments that the Government can back this afternoon to help them to grow the economy. Those amendments are, of course, new clause 89 and new clause 90.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
 Businesses need to ensure that the process for terminating is not unduly onerous and that consumers can signal their intent to end the contract through a single communication.	Labour	Conservative Party
 The process will be cheaper than going through the courts—I believe it will be £50 cheaper—so why is the saving so small and not greater?	Conservative Party	Labour Party
The immediate cost savings to the courts will be made on staff, administration and court hearing times.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
I rise on behalf of my constituents in Farnham, Bordon, Haslemere and Liphook who are opposed to this fundamentally anti-business Bill.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
The Government claim to be pro-growth and pro-business, yet the Bill is precisely the opposite. The Institute of Directors has warned that it will lead to slower growth, deter investment and bury business under an avalanche of unnecessary regulation.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
But yet again, Ministers plough ahead, blind to the economic damage that they are about to unleash.	Labour Party	Conservative Party
The amendment and new clause seek to introduce an impact assessment before clause 21 and schedule 2 come into force. Without that, we have to be clear that businesses will be discouraged from hiring in the first place. Flexibility in employment is not one-sided, it benefits both workers and their employers	Labour Party	Conservative Party
That is why it is essential that we accept new clause 87 in the name of the shadow Secretary of State, because we need an impact assessment of how the Bill will affect businesses.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
I am also pleased to see Government new clause 34 encouraging greater employer compliance and increasing compensation for workers subjected to fire and rehire by raising the maximum period of the protective award from 90 to 180 days.	Labour Party	Labour Party
It is therefore not just my former pupils but millions across the country who will benefit from the biggest upgrade to rights at work in a generation.	Labour Party	Labour Party

We have an opportunity to give carers in employment a fair deal right across the country, while also bolstering our economy.	Labour Party	Liberal Democrats
The Government have an opportunity to build on the Carer’s Leave Act 2023, introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for North East Fife (Wendy Chamberlain), and take the next step in providing working carers with the flexibility they need to juggle work and care.	Labour Party	Liberal Democrats
A lot of those discussing this behave as if employees with unfair dismissal rights were unexploded bombs. All the people I represented did not want to bring tribunal claims, they just wanted to have been treated fairly and reasonably in the first place.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
We must be able to have confidence that when strikes occur, people’s lives and livelihoods are not put at undue risk.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
As has become clear from recent industrial action, that is not always the case, so we need a safety net in place to ensure that the public do not become collateral damage.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
Do the Government really believe that withdrawing the right of a worker to withdraw their labour is what they are about?	Labour Party	Democratic Unionist Party
There are those who, at the most terrifying time of their lives—perhaps with a poorly loved one—do not know whether an ambulance will arrive, because the unions have refused to provide a national safety net.	Conservatives	Conservative Party
If this is all about safety, why is the word “safety” not used once in the Bill or its explanatory notes?	Conservative Party	Scottish National Party
The Bill will ensure that we protect the ability of workers to take industrial action, but that we also protect the public from disproportionate disruption to their daily lives and that, to put it simply, one person’s right to strike does not infringe on someone else’s right to life and limb.	Conservatives	Conservative Party
I refer Opposition Members to the voluntary arrangements that were successfully made with the Royal College of Nursing, which did provide a national guarantee. In that case, it would not be necessary to put the measures in place.	Labour Party	Conservative Party
What has happened in that disruption is that although the nurses have very sensibly provided a national level of safe service, unfortunately the same has not happened in the ambulance service. That is why this legislation is required in other areas at this time	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
Last week, and in December, arrangements were being disputed right up to the wire—right up to the last minute—which created uncertainty and left officials with little time to organise contingency measures such as military support. That is the situation that we cannot, in all conscience, allow to continue.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
The Secretary of State is pretending that the Bill is about democracy rather than being a vindictive attack on working people. If it is really about democracy and opening things up, why is he not lifting the ban on unions balloting online and in the workplace, which would be precisely the way to make a modern democracy work?	Labour Party	Green Party
If this is such a fair and reasonable Bill, why does the right hon. Gentleman�s predecessor, Vince Cable, say that it is both �vindictive� and �unnecessary�?	Labour Party	Labour and Co-Operative Party
Hon. Members from both sides of this House are, to some extent, insulated from the consequences of strike action. We are lucky enough to have generous travel expenses so that we can hire a car or a taxi when there is a transport strike. We have secure jobs, where we get paid whether we make it into the office or not. Even a Back Bencher is among the top 5% of UK earners, so  we can afford to deal with the childcare costs that might come with a school closure or some disruption. But what about the low-paid restaurant staff who miss a day�s work and a day�s pay because of a stoppage called by a handful of transport workers? What about the self-employed builder who has to turn down a week-long job because a strike by teachers means that his kids cannot go to school? What about the single mother who cannot afford to lose a day�s pay by refusing to cross a picket line? Should she be subjected to abuse and harassment simply for going to work?	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. At the heart of this Bill is partnership�partnership between trade unions and employers and other stakeholders. A great example of that can be seen at Toyota in Britain. It has not had one day of industrial action in  20 years, and that is because of the partnership that it rightly has with its trade union	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
The Secretary of State is giving the House the impression that London commuters would somehow be protected by his threshold. Is he aware that the recent industrial action on the tube  would have passed those thresholds? He talks about partnership. Is it not the case that it is not the strikes and the ballots that are the problems, but the intransigent Mayor of London who is sitting behind him?	Conservative Party	Labour Party
The Bill provides that voting papers sent to union members and employers will state the details of the trade dispute, exactly what type of industrial action is proposed, and an indication of the time period in which that action will take place. This will ensure that members know exactly what they are voting for or against and allow them to make an informed decision.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
The Secretary of State discounts e-balloting because of potential fraud. How about considering an amendment to the Bill with regards to balloting in the workplace, where there cannot be any fraud whatsoever? It will be democratised and there will be a huge turnout on every occasion, which is surely what the Secretary of State is seeking to implement.	Labour Party	Labour Party
Secondly	 demoralise them.�	 unions will need to obtain the active consent of members to deduct a political levy. At present
In fact, in Northern Ireland, members have had an active choice for almost 90 years and their unions are still perfectly able to operate and to organise. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and the Prison Officers Association still have more than four fifths of their members choosing to opt in. All we are asking is for a simple tick box on the same membership forms in England, Scotland and Wales.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
 This is an issue of transparency. It is about ensuring that when people, rightly, give money to any political party, they know that they are doing so and do it with their eyes wide open.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
 Does he agree that the Bill is anti-business and anti-working practice and that most employers that have trade unions recognise their value?	Scottish National Party	Labour Party
She says, rightly, that the number of days lost to strikes in the UK is at its lowest for 20 years. It is even more significant than that: we lose fewer days to strike action in the UK today than we did during the second world war. There is no problem here that needs fixing.	Conservative Party	Labour and Co-Operative Party
The ILO has already criticised the UK on a number of occasions for  its constraints on the right to strike, and the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association has called for more, not less, trade union freedom in Britain.	Labour Party	Labour Party
It is right that the Bill brings in protection for hard-working people who want proper workplace representation rather than just a cash cow to be milked by union leaders for their own political game.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
 The Bill will lead to a deterioration of good industrial relations and it has no support within public opinion. It is designed to reduce civil liberties and human rights.	Labour Party	Scottish National Party
Nothing in this Bill infringes the right to strike. It asks trade union bosses to achieve a higher mandate for those strikes.	Scottish National Party	Conservative Party
 It is right that this House rebalances our trade union laws in favour of all working people. It seems entirely reasonable, therefore, that, among other sensible reforms and amendments, we introduce a 50% threshold for ballot turnout and a 40% support threshold for key public services.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
the Bill does not say that there are industries in which strikes should not take place, it is an effort to affect  millions of trade unionists and inhibit their right to strike because of a dispute involving a few thousand people at London Underground.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
but if their concern is for human rights and civil liberties they cannot defend that measure. It is literally indefensible.	Labour Party	Labour Party
the Bill did go before the Regulatory Policy Committee, which was scathing about three aspects of the legislation it was asked to examine, including the thresholds for 40% and 50%. It gave a red card to all three, deeming them not fit for purpose and stating that the Government had not provided sufficient evidence of the likely impact of the proposals to support the consultation.	Labour Party	Labour Party
The Bill pushes us towards a more adversarial relationship between management and the workforce. Does the Minister really think that deals such as those done on behalf of  the UK economy with GM or Nissan will be made easier through this Bill when its provisions lend themselves to mutual suspicion, acrimony, work-to-rule and more disruptive industrial relations? The ability of this country to land more inward investment is compromised through the Bill.	Labour Party	Labour Party
 Under clause 6, the Bill imposes such burdensome regulation that it puts the EU banana straightening compliance team to shame. The extension of the roles and powers of the certification officer will impose additional administrative and financial pressures on unions. There will be a reporting requirement as to whether industrial action took place in the past 12 months, the nature of the dispute and the action that was taken.	Labour Party	Labour Party
In an economy that is becoming increasingly characterised by unequal, low-skilled and insecure employment with workers employed in small companies or often categorised as self-employed, the challenge of collective bargaining and how unions can work to play a positive role should be considered and encouraged, yet this petty and vindictive Bill does nothing to deal with that. 	Labour Party	Labour Party
Those comments serve only to fuel concerns that union leaders	Conservatives	 emboldened and unchallenged by the Labour party
In conclusion, I have been lobbied at great length regarding this Bill, but on close analysis I believe it to be both proportionate and necessary. Trade union members have the right to be protected from being exploited not only by their employer, but by their union bosses who seek to use them to further their own political aims.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
We have heard about wildcat strikes	Labour and Co-Operative Party	 but I am afraid that this Bill might bring them back big style. Once unions are shackled through the ballots and the thresholds
The check-off, the paying-in or the opt-out of the political levy is another issue. That has annoyed me more than anything. The hypocrisy of this Government in trying to stop trade unions paying into the political levy is obvious. The political levy goes not just to the Labour party but to a lot of organisations. It could be asked why the Government are doing this. Perhaps they are trying to stop trade unionists putting money into Labour, perhaps they want to crush the party by stopping its money.	Labour Party	Labour Party
The Bill is part of a jigsaw of legislation that the Government have forced through during more than one parliamentary term. They are extending the role of the certification officer in regulating trade unions, which includes the granting of a new power to impose fines. That simply means the introduction of a new trade union tax: the unions will have to pay for the investigatory powers of the certification officer. It is ludicrous, and it is against democracy.	Labour Party	Labour Party
I completely reject those comments. There is nothing in this Bill that is offensive: it is a moderate Bill that is attempting to balance the rights�[Interruption.] Absolutely, it is a moderate Bill that is balancing the right to strike with the rights of people who are trying to earn a living in difficult circumstances, and trying to get to work or go about their daily business.	Conservatives	Conservative Party
Peaceful protest is an important part of an open and democratic society, and there should be no place for a law that makes criminals of people making their voices heard in this way. But the Minister�s eagerness to undermine the trades unions, and put limits on their members� rights to freedom of expression, makes me wonder exactly what it is that he is scared of.	Labour Party	Labour Party
The recently announced extension of pay restraint will hurt these workers for a further four years, with most having already been hit pretty hard with poorer deals on pensions,	Labour Party	Labour Party
I would also welcome any clarity the Minister can provide around how he intends to escape the inevitable confusion arising when attempting to ballot a workplace where some occupations are covered by the �important public services� provisions and others are not. Will the Minister give further details on the requirement for �reasonably detailed� information to be provided on ballot papers? If a failure to provide such information is to be a basis for legal action by employers against workers taking industrial action, it is crucial that the House should be informed in advance of how �reasonably detailed� is to be defined	Labour Party	Labour Party
It simply seeks to balance the interests of the workers in the trade union against those of other workers who are subjected to the effects of the strike.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development has suggested that the Bill is dealing with problems of the past and has nothing to do with the current situation?	UK Government	Scottish National Party
What this Bill will do is: ensure that any disagreement is squashed by management, without any constructive dialogue, render any dialogue that there is futile, and ensure that the important and constructive voices of staff are lost, drowned in a welter of arguments about  minutiae of process or brushed aside. This Bill is a recipe for turning disagreement into conflict, and for escalating a short-term problem into a fundamental break in relationships in the workplace.	Conservative Party	Scottish National Party
Even the Chancellor is now persuaded that low pay is a problem that we have to grapple with, so we must wonder why the Government are so keen to introduce this Bill.	Labour Party	Scottish National Party
First, on the issue of the 40% additional threshold, I am pleased that the Government are looking at consultation, but the points made about the ability of the union leadership to control and minimise wildcat strikes do carry quite a weight. It would be interesting for the Minister to consider whether the notice period of 14 days before strike action will achieve most of the goals that are seen as required for that 40% threshold. May I encourage the Minister to include in clause 6(1), on information to the certification officer, a provision about the outcome of the industrial action? That information is useful for members, too. If they are asked to go on strike, they should know what the consequence of the strike was�what they achieved by it�so they can see whether such action is playing a good role.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
This is a Bill of naked discrimination against the trade unions, designed to cut the funding of the Labour party severely and, thus, to entrench the Tory party in power, as well as to make it almost impossible to strike in certain industrial sectors.	Labour Party	Labour Party
The best answer to that was that given by The Times commentator	Conservative Party	 Philip Collins
The last thing that the workers want to do is to go on strike, but when they have genuine, reasonable and pressing demands over such essential issues such as job losses, safety problems and pay, and those demands are swept to one side, as they often are, with little or no negotiation, they have no alternative but to take industrial action. To blame and penalise them and not bad management, as the Tory party and its pals in the media automatically do, is a total charade.	Conservatives	Labour Party
I declare my interest as a member of Unite the union. The Bill exposes the Government�s self-appointed title as the workers� party and their claim to be the party for working people as little more than empty rhetoric devised by the spin doctors at Tory HQ. It is a total misnomer to claim to be the party for working people while simultaneously steamrolling over those very workers� democratic rights and civil liberties	Scottish National Party	Labour Party
The Government are carrying out this attack on trade unions not for practical reasons supported by evidence, but out of their ideological commitment to fighting the battles of generations past and to pursuing their mission to weaken and destroy the labour and trade union movement.	Scottish National Party	Labour Party
�legislation on this subject	Conservative Party	 which would affect the funding of the Labour party
These proposals are so unreasonable and extreme that they will undoubtedly raise the serious prospect of legal challenge. The interference of the state in the affairs of trade unions is counter to article 11 of the European convention on human rights. We are signatories to the European social charter and as a nation we agreed in article 5 that our national laws would not restrict the freedom of workers to form and join organisations for the protection of their economic and social interests. The Bill directly contravenes our country�s commitment under the charter.	Labour Party	Labour Party
Our rights were not handed down from above, they were fought for tooth and nail, often against Conservative Governments. Government Members should be aware that those rights will not be given up easily. If the Government continue with their authoritarian plan to abuse their time in office by attacking our democratic rights, they would be wise to remember that for every action there is a reaction.	Labour Party	Labour Party
But does the hon. Gentleman accept that those strikes have tripled since the Tories took over in London in 2008? It is an absolute disgrace that the Mayor of London has never sat down and met the trade unions and treated them as though they were equal partners or human beings in the same race.	Scottish National Party	Labour Party
I therefore welcome the measures in the Bill to provide more clarity and democracy. The Bill will improve trade union practices and increase transparency. I particularly commend three measures: first, time-limited mandates, which will improve clarity and democratic legitimacy, secondly, the requirement for a clear description of the planned industrial action, which is fair and reasonable, and thirdly, the proposal for a new, transparent opt-in system for political subscriptions, which is welcome.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
The cost of this last-minute, poorly supported industrial action is substantial. It hurts our economy at home and hinders our competitiveness on the world stage. If we are to run and win the global race for success in an increasingly competitive global market, we need our shops and businesses to be open, generating wealth, we need our students and apprentices at school or college learning and developing the skills to win, and we need our workers and communities on the move, not stuck at home. We simply cannot afford the lost wealth that poorly supported strikes cause.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
Over the past five years, the relationship between the Government and a number of public sector unions has been particularly difficult. It is called austerity. It is called having your income limited, perhaps when you have a partner and children at home and have to try to keep their heads above water. It is about being called �difficult� when perhaps some of your neighbours who work in the private sector are able to carry on getting their income increased and looking after themselves. That is why there is disgruntlement.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
Individually and cumulatively, these proposals will fundamentally damage the capacity of unions to organise strikes. Many of these are not needed, but having the right to go on strike is an important tool on the table when you are sat down negotiating on behalf of members.	Labour Party	Labour Party
The approach we take in Scotland is fundamentally respectful, acknowledging the overwhelming prevalence and importance of negotiation in trade union activity. That negotiation contributes to improved employment practice and improved outcomes for both the workforce and employers.	Labour Party	Scottish National Party
I am so minded by personal experience: when the National Union of Teachers was on strike in 2012, that had an impact on me as a parent. I certainly remember that the turnout was 27% of all members, so the impact on children and parents�my constituents�seemed completely disproportionate to the number who voted in favour of the strike.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
On legitimacy	Labour and Co-Operative Party	 looking at the current labour market
I also believe that opting in�members having to make a conscious decision to join a union�makes absolute sense. In every other walk of life, we would expect our constituents to have to join up to a party, not become members by default.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
My hon. Friend the Member for Blyth  Valley (Mr Campbell) and other hon. Members have made interesting comparisons with hedge funds, the banking system and the financial sector. Such organisations and institutions promoted the casino economy that brought Britain, and indeed the world, to the brink of financial disaster. Yet, they seem to be allowed to wield considerable and unfettered political influence, and there is no proposal for similar constraints or levels of transparency. Our recovery is being built on a private debt bubble, and as austerity fails to eradicate the deficit or to improve the income or living standards for ordinary people, it is more important than ever for them to have a trade union to represent their interests.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
In addition to significant and unnecessary new burdens, trade unions will also be expected to pay a levy to fund the certification officers� new role. As we heard from the Secretary of State, the role will be much more proactive. They will have new powers to impose financial penalties and to scrutinise how unions use their political funds and for what purposes.	Labour Party	Labour Party
The Bill is an unnecessary and vindictive attack on trade unions and undermines the democratic rights of working people, and I urge everybody in the House to vote against it.	Labour Party	Labour Party
I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. In fact, many of the issues raised could be dealt with through general legislation rather than a specific trade union Bill.	Conservative Party	Scottish National Party
By my counting, there were 10 Acts between 1980 and 1996 that attacked the trade unions. The coalition Government, much to their shame, tied in a further assault on trade unions with the issue of trust in politics in the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014.	Labour Party	Plaid Cymru
The UK has some of the most restrictive trade union laws in the western world.	Labour Party	Plaid Cymru
The freedom to speak out against injustice and to campaign for economic equality and the rights and freedoms of workers is underpinned by the European convention on human rights�rights that were bitterly fought for by the blood, sweat and tears of our ancestors. The Government claim that they are forced to amend those rights, and we are led to believe that that is because the number of strikes called in recent years is a threat to our economic wellbeing. The total number of days lost in the 12 months preceding April 2015 was  704,000, but before the House becomes hysterical about that, it is important to note that historically that figure was in the millions. In fact, we are experiencing an all-time low for strike action, and it is at its lowest level since before 1990. The simple truth is that workers do not take the decision to strike lightly, and they never have.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
and poses a real and present danger to our economic viability as a nation. I call on Members to reject this Bill today. Failure to do so will open an economic and democratic Pandora�s box that unleashes something so pernicious that we will not be able to close the lid again.	Labour Party	Labour Party
 As a former trade union officer and a proud trade union MP, I am disgusted that the Government are prepared to undermine a vital component of British public life for the sake of narrow political self-interest.	Labour Party	Labour Party
I saw no evidence from any management I worked with of a desire within British industry to bring in such legislation.	Conservatives	Labour Party
The Bill would be bad for the economy, because trade unions�yes, working with management�help to spread the wealth that the country creates. The richest countries are not the ones with the 1% wealthiest elite, but the ones with the highest average wages.	Conservatives	Labour Party
The Bill is about power. It is about removing power from any form of organised opposition to the Conservatives� dominance. They know that individual people are stronger when they stand together and therefore opposition to the Conservatives will be weakened by removing that collectivism, as my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Nick Thomas-Symonds) explained so eloquently.	Labour Party	Labour Party
In typically cynical and dishonest fashion, they cloak the Bill in the claim of protecting the public when in fact it does the opposite: it makes families and ordinary people much more insecure by taking away one of the few avenues of protection they have in their economic and working lives.	Scottish National Party	Labour Party
The SNP strongly opposes the proposed reforms, because they will erode democracy in the workplace. The Bill would restrict the power of devolved Administrations, local governments and other public bodies to determine their own industrial relations.	Scottish National Party	Scottish National Party
Are the measures in the Bill necessary in a democratic society? I place the burden on the Government to justify them as proportional, and I implore the House to oppose this arbitrary Bill.	Labour Party	Scottish National Party
We have heard about democracy and the fact that abstentions would count as no votes, we would not expect that of a totalitarian regime or a dictatorship.	Labour Party	Labour and Co-Operative Party
We should protect their right to strike with every breath we have.	Conservative Party	Scottish National Party
This Bill will damage workers� rights and impose undemocratic and hypocritical restrictions on the right to strike.	Scottish National Party	Scottish National Party
There is a huge economic case for retaining the current arrangements.	Labour Party	Labour Party
It seems to me that the Bill is an attempt to create easy headlines about the way in which the Government are clamping down on unions, playing to a rhetoric that is based not on fact but on prejudice�and boy, have we  heard plenty of prejudice from the Government Benches today.

Why the requirement for 40%, we might ask. That is simply the result of a calculation by the Government that, when opinion is divided, a union will have to have participation levels of 80% or more. They rightly think that that will be very difficult to obtain, and of course they are doing nothing to improve participation through e-balloting or other contemporary mechanisms. This is simply a ploy to prevent people from going on strike.	Labour Party	Scottish National Party
As a trade unionist, I knew that taking strike action was a last resort, and not one that any of us wanted to take, but when all else fails, that is what is left. Without it, the bad bosses would not want to negotiate in the first place.	Labour Party	Labour Party

The UK is wages-led: it is wages, not profits, that drive growth in our economy. If profit shares go up, as has been the case for the past four decades, demand actually decreases. A 1% increase in the profit share leads to a 0.13% decrease in demand, which is a loss of �2.21 billion to the economy at today�s levels.	Labour Party	Labour Party
This Bill goes against the best traditions of the Conservative party. If its members believe in free markets, they must surely believe in free labour. Perhaps that is why, in 1948, Winston Churchill opposed attempts to politicise the attacks on party political funding and the funding of a Labour party. Perhaps that is also why, in 1984, Margaret Thatcher said that the Conservative party should tread with caution before behaving in such a partisan way.	Labour Party	Labour Party
They think that this is purely about the funding of our party, but it is not, it is about values and belief in democracy, equality, collectivism and social justice. Those are the values of the real party of the workers, and that is why I oppose this Bill.	Labour Party	Labour Party
The Scottish Trades Union Congress reports that international evidence clearly indicates that where unions are able to negotiate collectively with employers, wages are fairer and, as a direct consequence, societies are more equal.	Labour Party	Scottish National Party
I hope they succeed in convincing some of their colleagues that with the measures in this Bill they are grossly overreaching themselves.	Scottish National Party	Labour Party
It is perverse to claim to support trade unions with one breath and then to support this regressive Bill with  another. It is already difficult to arrange a strike, with indicative ballots. My union has a 50-page document to guide people through the process of securing a ballot.	Scottish National Party	Labour Party
The right to strike is one of the fundamental rights on which civil society is based. It encapsulates the rights of freedom of assembly and protest for which generations of men and women have fought and struggled. The establishment and defence of these rights is one of the most vital threads in our national story.	Labour Party	Labour Party
Strikes are a symptom of poor industrial relations, not a cause.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
It is also important to remember that women have borne a higher share of the burden of this Government�s austerity policies than men. Women have already suffered more from welfare cuts and pay freezes, and I am concerned that this Bill will make those inequalities much worse.	Conservative Party	Labour Party
This is an excellent Bill�a serious, sensible Bill. It has been striking that not a single Labour Member has stood up during this debate to condemn the strikes that are caused by a tiny minority of the workforce. Not a single one of them has condemned it. That tells us all we need to know about the Labour party. It no longer speaks for the working people of this country.	Conservative Party	Conservative Party
The Bill will only add greater uncertainty to what can and cannot be done and, in my view, is likely to lead to greater politicisation, not less.	Labour Party	Labour Party
The hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke) urged a rethink on agency workers. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis), who had already told us that parts of the Bill were reminiscent of Franco, rightly spoke about the serious restrictions on freedom of association and the risk of judicial review.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	Labour and Co-Operative Party
Does my hon. Friend agree that as the Bill is a fundamental attack on democracy, human rights and trade unions, it will boost Labour party membership by thousands more as people protest against this evil Bill?	Scottish National Party	Labour Party
My noble Friends in the other place may be interested to note that the Bill breaches a Conservative manifesto commitment to make provisions regarding only essential public services. �Essential� is the word used in International Labour Organisation conventions, and it has a very narrow definition. Instead, the Bill talks about �important� public services and draws its provisions so wide that as yet unseen powers could apply to nearly every area of publicly funded activity.

Recently, the Prime Minister outlined the Government’s priorities: to build a better, more secure and more prosperous future, one that this country and our workforce—public or private—fully deserve.	Labour Party	not_statement

I note, however, that the hon<prd> Gentleman did not mention the fact that he has received £94,000-plus from unions.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Now, I have no issue with him receiving that money from unions—I do not think that we should have taxpayer-funded political parties in this House—but I think it is only right that when Opposition Members stand up, they reflect what is on their records, which is that they have received a lot of money from unions and now seek to represent them in the debate.

] I hear the barracking and understand that Opposition Members do not want to hear what people throughout the country are feeling, but it is a fact that when strikes are on and ambulances are unable to find out from their unions whether they will operate, that is an additional concern for members of the public—including Opposition Members’ constituents, whom they seem rather not to care about in this case.

The Secretary of State needs to acknowledge that before we move on to discuss anything else.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I am surprised by how the hon<prd> Gentleman, who normally speaks a lot of sense in the House, put his point across.	Labour Party	not_statement
Yes, of course it is the case that the NHS has been under unbelievable stress, not least because of two years of covid and all the backlog that has been created.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is worth reminding Labour Members that, had they had their way, we would have been in lockdown for a heck of a lot longer and those cases would have been even worse.	Labour Party	not_statement
I do not follow the logic of his argument.	Conservative Party	not_statement
He seems to be arguing that just because there are times of danger, we ought, by design, to enable a system that prevents unions in the ambulance service from telling the NHS when ambulances will be there and what the minimum service would be.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is the issue that we seek to address today.	Conservative Party	not_statement

I will rephrase what I was saying.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Will the Secretary of State ensure that he reflects the truth of what happens in the NHS?	Labour Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I would just say to the hon<prd> Lady, who I know has received money from GMB, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, Unite the union, CLP among others—nothing wrong with that; I am just putting it on the record—that she is wrong factually about the way the last two strikes, last week and in December, occurred.

Sir Chris Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab) rose—  Grant Shapps I am actually answering the hon<prd> Gentleman’s colleague’s point.	UK Government	not_statement
One at a time.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The way that ambulance strike worked was that the NHS was unable to find out in advance from the ambulance unions where and when, nationwide, cover would be provided.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is the NHS that said that, not the Government.	Labour Party	not_statement
As a result, the NHS has not been able to put the appropriate level of cover in place in advance.	Conservative Party	not_statement
If by chance we are wrong about that, there is a safety mechanism in the Bill for that.	Labour Party	not_statement
Although we are taking primary powers, should Parliament so decide, we have said we do not want to use them if voluntary arrangements can be made.	Labour Party	not_statement
I refer Opposition Members to the voluntary arrangements—  Grant Shapps Let me finish the first point and move on with the speech.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I refer Opposition Members to the voluntary arrangements that were successfully made with the Royal College of Nursing, which did provide a national guarantee.	Labour Party	not_statement
In that case, it would not be necessary to put the measures in place.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I hope the House will appreciate that there are a lot of people who want to contribute.	Labour Party	not_statement
I want to give people the opportunity to do that in their own speeches.	Conservative Party	not_statement

Joanna Cherry (Edinburgh South West) (SNP) Can the Secretary of State help me with this?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
That does not appear in the human rights memorandum that accompanies this Bill.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Has the Government’s legal advice changed or have they just changed their mind for reasons of political convenience?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps The hon<prd> and learned Lady must surely have noticed that we have subsequently had disruption in the NHS, including in the ambulance service.	Conservative Party	not_statement
What has happened in that disruption is that although the nurses have very sensibly provided a national level of safe service, unfortunately the same has not happened in the ambulance service.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is why this legislation is required in other areas at this time.	Labour Party	not_statement
Joanna Cherry rose—  Amy Callaghan (East Dunbartonshire) (SNP) rose—  Richard Graham (Gloucester) (Con) rose—  Grant Shapps I have given way once to the hon<prd> and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry), so I give way to my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham).	Conservative Party	not_statement
Richard Graham My right hon<prd> Friend is under a constant onslaught of noise from Opposition Members, who show terrific support for those in the unions in their constituencies and for those in the unions funding their constituency offices, but who seem to forget the interests of all our constituents, which are in the minimum service level agreements that my right hon<prd> Friend is proposing.	Conservative Party	not_statement

That is not how we want the debate to continue.	Conservatives	not_statement
It is an important subject, so let us try to introduce moderation into our discussion.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps My hon<prd> Friend the Member for Gloucester is absolutely right about the reason for requiring minimum standards.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Amy Callaghan Will the Secretary of State give way?	Labour Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I will in a moment, if I can make a little progress.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Bill is clear, however, that such regulations may be made only after appropriate consultation and the approval of both Houses.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Amy Callaghan I thank the Secretary of State for acknowledging my presence in the Chamber after so many attempts to intervene.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I simply do not accept that point.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Although it is true that life-and-limb measures exist, we have seen through the many months of rail closures and the strikes that took place last week and in December that unfortunately minimum service levels in one case, and actually minimum safety levels in another, have simply not been available.	Conservative Party	not_statement
They seem to imagine that the Army will just be there at no notice and with no ability to organise which areas of the country it needs to be in.	Labour Party	not_statement

I cannot hear the answer that the Secretary of State is giving to the question.	Labour Party	not_statement
There is no point in just shouting when he is actually answering the question.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I suppose the fundamental point is that we hope very much that, in many cases, we will not need to use the powers conferred by the legislation, but we have seen that that will not always be possible.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Sir Chris Bryant I am a member of the GMB.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I happen not to have received any money from the GMB, although I would be proud to do so—certainly a lot prouder that I would be of receiving £2<prd>5 million from Lubov Chernukhin.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Can the Secretary of State confirm that this legislation cannot possibly be used to sort out the present winter of discontent?	Labour Party	not_statement
If anything, it will make it far more difficult to secure a resolution of any of the individual strikes, and therefore it is just political posturing.	Labour Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I think the GMB will have heard the hon<prd> Gentleman’s pitch for some money.	Conservative Party	not_statement
If he gets that money, it will join the £120 million that the unions have supplied to the Labour party since 2010.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I make this point only because it is relevant to today’s debate.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We must be here to represent our constituents, and our constituents know from paying attention to the recent strikes that when the Royal College of Nursing worked with the NHS, it was able to provide timely assurances at a national level to ensure that the most critical services—including chemotherapy, critical care, paediatric and A&amp;E—were not affected, which shows that even when parties disagree, they can do so in a mature manner.	Labour Party	not_statement
Unfortunately, however, that is not always the case.	Conservative Party	not_statement
During recent strike action by the ambulance service—this has been referred to a couple of times, and I want to read it out because it is written down—the NHS has not been reassured by the relevant union that it can rely on the current system of voluntary local derogation, which I think is what the hon<prd> Member for York Central was talking about earlier.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It could not rely on those arrangements to ensure that patient and public services were provided.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Last week, and in December, arrangements were being disputed right up to the wire—right up to the last minute—which created uncertainty and left officials with little time to organise contingency measures such as military support.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is the situation that we cannot, in all conscience, allow to continue.	Conservatives	not_statement
Charlotte Nichols (Warrington North) (Lab) I declare that I am a proud member of a trade union, and was a trade union officer for a number of years before coming here.	Labour Party	not_statement
In fact, I have probably been part of 1,000 or so pay-and-conditions negotiations, all of which were resolved, with employer and employees all perfectly happy with the outcome.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is something that the Secretary of State has been unable to do, whether in relation to the railway or much more widely, which is why we are having this debate.	Conservatives	not_statement
Grant Shapps Let me say this, in fairness to the hon<prd> Lady.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is the case that the employers and the unions, and more recently Ministers as well, have been meeting, and it is also the case that even when there have been ministerial meetings—including in Scotland and Labour Wales—the disputes have continued.	Labour Party	not_statement
After all, strokes and heart attacks do not respect boundaries such as trust borders.	Conservative Party	not_statement

It is not the case that the strikes are always perfectly safe for our constituents.	Conservatives	not_statement
That is why we must act.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I will make a little more progress, because I think that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, would like to hear from other Members, and I have been as generous as possible in allowing interventions.	Scottish National Party	not_statement

Grant Shapps I will give way in just a moment, but I would like to get through a bit more first.	Conservative Party	not_statement
They use minimum service levels in a common-sense way to reduce the impact of strikes.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is what we are doing.	Labour Party	not_statement
Our own unions subscribe to and support the ILO, as do we.	Labour	not_statement
Will the Secretary of State admit that this law is just to ban people from taking the legal action to strike?	Conservatives	not_statement
Grant Shapps I agree that we have had a good working relationship for the last several decades.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The hon<prd> Lady is right to point out that, as a result, over the last two or three decades we have typically suffered fewer strikes than some in continental Europe.	Conservative Party	not_statement
This Government will not stand by and watch that happen.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Siobhan Baillie (Stroud) (Con) There is a lot of focus on in Europe, but I would like to focus on Gloucestershire, where nurses have chosen not to strike.	Labour	not_statement
I thank them for that and for all the work they do in Stroud.	Conservative Party	not_statement

We are protecting those rights.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps My hon<prd> Friend is absolutely right.	Conservative Party	not_statement
This is about minimum standards.	Conservatives	not_statement
For anyone who cares about the ability to take industrial action and to strike, what we are doing here enshrines that.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
That is a very different proposition, which I am proud to support.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Government expect to consult on minimum service levels for ambulance, fire and rail services first.	Conservatives	not_statement
It is expected that these consultations will be published during the passage of this Bill.	Labour Party	not_statement
At the same time as bringing forward the legislation, the Government are doing all they can to continue the discussions that everybody is calling for to ensure that we get a pay settlement with unions that is affordable for the unions, for the country and for the workers paying for it.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Peter Dowd (Bootle) (Lab) As far as I can tell, the Government have ruled out voluntary options 1 and 2 in their assessment, on the basis that they will be ineffective, particularly where unions and employers have major disagreements.	Labour Party	not_statement
The question is: why and how have the Government arrived at that decision now, in advance of the legislation itself?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps It is because we were given adequate demonstration from the recent strikes that unfortunately in some cases the unions involved have not acted in the national interest, whereas others—the RCN, for example—have very much done so.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I want to stress what I said at the top of my speech, which is that I do not want us to have to use this legislation if it is not required.	Labour Party	not_statement
We have live strikes going on, so we will be able to see where it is required and where it is not.	Labour Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps I feel I have been generous in allowing interventions and it is right to complete my segment so that others can get on and speak.	Conservatives	not_statement
Tommy Sheppard (Edinburgh East) (SNP) Can the Secretary of State tell the House how many people died in the care of the national health service during the recent periods of industrial unrest who would not have died had the provisions of this Bill been in force at the time?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Grant Shapps The problem, as people will recognise, is that as we do not have a nationally agreed level of coverage—particularly in the ambulance service—it is difficult to know or predict what would have happened if the Army had not stepped in.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I know from talking to colleagues and officials that one of the problems was that, because of the late notice and the randomised trust-by-trust agreements, they have been unable to put in a national framework that would mean that it would not matter if you lived in Islington North or somewhere else; you would still get coverage on strike days.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Nadia Whittome Does the Secretary of State see the irony in expecting unions to ensure minimum safe service levels on strike days when his own Government are failing to do so on every other day?	Conservatives	not_statement
What does he make of nurses’ reports that staffing levels are in fact safer on strike days because the unions are negotiating appropriate cover compared with non-strike days?	Labour	not_statement
Grant Shapps I did not quite follow the hon<prd> Lady’s point on the railways.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The railways on strike days are finding it hard to offer any services at all, even for key workers and the people the Opposition sometimes claim to represent the most, such as the hard-working cleaner or the hospital porter.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The people who cannot do their jobs remotely are unable to get to their jobs and they are losing money.	Labour Party	not_statement
They are becoming fed up with the forever strikes where the unions simply will not put the offer to their members in order for the members to have a say.	Conservatives	not_statement
Minimum service levels are important for that reason, and I have covered numerous times why we think minimum safety levels protect people’s lives.	Conservatives	not_statement
I commend the Bill to the House.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton) As colleagues can see, well over 50 hon<prd> and right hon<prd> Members are wishing to catch my eye.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Before I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I want to inform colleagues that there will be an immediate four-minute time limit on Back-Bench speeches so that we can try to get everybody in.	Conservative Party	not_statement
18:05:00  Angela Rayner (Ashton-under-Lyne) (Lab) First, let me declare an interest as a proud lifelong trade unionist.	Labour Party	not_statement
I regret the tone of the Secretary of State’s speech today.	Parliament	not_statement
If he is implying in any way that Members of the House do not care about their constituents or put their constituents first, or that members of our vital public services who got us through the pandemic do not take the safety of the people they look after seriously and would walk away, I think he should reflect on his comments.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I have been a Member of this House for some seven years now, and I cannot recall a measure that is at once so irrational and so insulting.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We will oppose the sacking of nurses Bill, and it is not just about nurses but about the many key workers who we clapped and who kept our services going in the face of the pandemic.	Labour	not_statement
We will vote against this legislation tonight, and the next Labour Government will repeal it.	Labour Party	not_statement
We are in the middle of an economic crisis of the Government’s making.	Conservatives	not_statement
Working people are facing the largest fall in living standards in a generation.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
[Interruption.	Labour	not_statement
] The Secretary of State keeps shouting “Putin”, but what about Liz Truss?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Rosie Winterton) Order.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner What about the Conservatives crashing the economy?	Conservatives	not_statement
The Secretary of State forgets the fact that inflation has gone through the roof under their watch.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Thirteen years of Conservative failure.	Labour Party	not_statement
Members watching this debate and constituents up and down the country know the truth, and they will tell this Government what they think, come the next general election.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Working people are facing the largest fall in living standards in a generation.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
In-work poverty, insecure work and financial insecurity are rampant.	Labour Party	not_statement
Inflation is in double digits.	Conservatives	not_statement
It is in this context that we have seen the greatest levels of strike disruption in 33 years, with ambulance workers taking their first major strike action in decades and the first ever strike in the history of the Royal College of Nursing.	Labour Party	not_statement
Our posties, train drivers, Border Force, health workers, train cleaners and even Ministers’ own officials have taken action too.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Prime Minister will not admit it, but this is a crisis and it is a crisis of the Government’s making.	Labour	not_statement
This legislation does nothing to resolve the problems that they have caused.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
There is no common sense in it at all.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Kim Leadbeater (Batley and Spen) (Lab) I declare an interest as a proud trade union member.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Does my right hon<prd> Friend agree that this legislation does nothing to address the underlying reasons NHS staff and others have taken the incredibly difficult decision to strike?	Conservative Party	not_statement
We are going to spend a number of hours in here this evening, but surely that time would be much better spent by the Government getting round the table with members of the NHS, listening to their concerns and coming to a resolution that would help to move things forward, rather than wasting our time here this evening on this horrible piece of legislation.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner I thank my hon<prd> Friend for that contribution and I absolutely agree.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I was reflecting while the Secretary of State was making his opening speech, and I was thinking that, if I still worked in social care or one of the key public services—if I was paramedic, a nurse or one of those key workers he mentioned—and I was listening to this debate, I would be really upset and offended by the way he represented them here today.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is not what the Labour party thinks of those key workers.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Secretary of State has claimed that this legislation is about public safety, so why does the Bill not mention safety once?	Labour Party	not_statement
He knows full well that working people already take steps to protect the public during strikes through derogations and voluntary agreements, yet he brazenly claims that this punitive legislation is needed because of ambulance workers.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is insulting and shameful, and I think he should apologise for the way in which he has awfully smeared ambulance workers.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Chris Stephens (Glasgow South West) (SNP) I thank my Unison comrade for giving way.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I am not a member of the parliamentary Labour party, but I am a proud trade unionist.	Labour Party	not_statement
This Bill is therefore completely unnecessary.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my friend.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We may not be in the same party, but we are in the same trade union.	Conservative Party	not_statement
These brave, hard-working men and women struck local life-and-limb deals on a trust-by-trust basis ahead of all the strikes.	Conservative Party	not_statement
[Interruption.	Labour	not_statement
] The Secretary of State says it is trust by trust, but it is the best way to ensure that the right care is provided, and those employers know that.	Conservative Party	not_statement
When I was a home help, we always put patient care first.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We negotiated to ensure minimum safety levels, which is more than I can say for the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, under whose watch we have seen excess deaths and an increasing crisis in the NHS.	Conservatives	not_statement
Ellie Reeves (Lewisham West and Penge) (Lab) I, too, declare an interest.	Conservative Party	not_statement
As a proud trade unionist and trade union lawyer for many years before entering Parliament, I represented striking workers day in, day out.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I know that no worker takes the decision to strike lightly.	Labour	not_statement
These strikes have been caused by the cost of living crisis caused by this Conservative Government.	Labour Party	not_statement
Does my right hon<prd> Friend agree that this Bill is just a further attack on workers’ rights, like the anti-trade union legislation passed by this Government in 2016?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
It is just another attack on working people who keep us safe, day in and day out.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree.	Conservative Party	not_statement
People watching this debate can see from the Secretary of State’s opening remarks, and from his previous remarks, what this is: a smokescreen about allegedly needing minimum service levels.	Conservatives	not_statement
We know that because, last autumn, his own Government assessed that minimum service levels were not needed for the emergency services due to existing regulations and voluntary arrangements.	Conservatives	not_statement
This is an attack on every nurse, health worker and firefighter in the country.	Labour Party	not_statement
They have gone from clapping nurses to sacking them.	Labour	not_statement
Charlotte Nichols My mam is a member of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, as I have previously noted in the House.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is interesting to hear what the Secretary of State says about the need for this Bill and legislation more widely because he was previously Secretary of State for Transport, and the only negotiations that have not been settled with the RMT are the ones in which the Department for Transport is involved.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Every other dispute with the RMT has been resolved.	Conservative Party	not_statement
So is this Bill not just covering up his failure to negotiate basic trade union agreements?	Labour Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner My hon<prd> Friend makes some important points.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We can all see from the reports on the negotiations that there was genuine hope we could get to a settlement, and then the Government decided to bring in new conditions at the last minute to make sure that the dispute continued.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is the Government, not the trade unions, who are acting militantly and who do not want to resolve these disputes.	Labour	not_statement
The Government should also reflect on the key workers and other workers who will be affected by this strike action, and who the Secretary of State says are putting lives at risk.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Even if they are not a key worker, I am pretty certain that most people, like my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Warrington North (Charlotte Nichols), have a friend, relative or someone they know who is.	Labour Party	not_statement
We all think they are heroes, and we all know they have their patients, the people they look after and the services they provide at the forefront of their mind.	Conservative Party	not_statement
No one wants to take strike action, least of all the workers who lose a day’s pay.	Labour Party	not_statement
I have long urged Ministers to do their job and resolve the underlying problems, but instead they have presented a Bill that tries to remove hundreds of thousands of workers’ historic right to withdraw their labour.	Labour	not_statement
It is not just wrong in principle; it is unworkable in practice.	Labour Party	not_statement
Dan Carden (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab) I declare my interest as a proud trade unionist.	Labour Party	not_statement
I meet striking workers on an almost weekly basis at the moment, and I know that working people are often targeted by employers during a dispute.	Conservatives	not_statement
This Bill hands employers the right to decide which worker goes to work and which worker can go on strike.	Labour Party	not_statement
Does my right hon<prd> Friend share my concern that this could allow bad bosses to victimise and target workers?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my hon<prd> Friend.	Conservative Party	not_statement
This legislation  “is not a solution to dealing with the industrial action we see at the moment.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
”  Those are not my words but the words of the Transport Secretary in December.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
This Bill could increase the frequency of strikes and the  “numbers of staff taking action short of striking”  and lead to employers finding that they are “low on staff.	Conservative Party	not_statement
” Again, those are not my words but the words of the Department for Transport’s impact assessment.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Minimum service levels are “not a game-changer” and could  “promote more industrial action than they mitigate.	Conservatives	not_statement
”  That is not me speaking but the senior Conservative adviser who developed the policy.	Labour Party	not_statement
The jury is in.	Labour Party	not_statement
These measures will not work, cannot work and will only make things worse.	Conservative Party	not_statement
James Sunderland (Bracknell) (Con) I remind the House that we have a number of sectors in the UK in which employees are not allowed to strike, namely the armed forces and the police.	Conservatives	not_statement
May I ask the right hon<prd> Lady to present an argument for why this provision should not be extended elsewhere?	Labour Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner I am glad the hon<prd> Gentleman got the crib sheet from the Whips.	Conservative Party	not_statement
There is a complete and utter lack of clarity about what these measures will mean for the six sectors to which they will apply.	Labour Party	not_statement
In nuclear decommissioning, for example, staff already have voluntary arrangements.	Conservative Party	not_statement
How will Ministers define minimum service in this sector?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Will they require just a teeny bit of decommissioning?	Conservative Party	not_statement
What about health?	Labour Party	not_statement
Will Ministers seriously sack doctors, nurses, paramedics and vital support staff at a time of critical NHS staff shortages?	Labour	not_statement
Apparently not, if the Government sources reported this week can be believed.	Labour Party	not_statement
Does the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy deny that the Health Secretary has told others to lobby the Prime Minister for improved pay offers?	Labour Party	not_statement
And can he really say that the Health Secretary believes this Bill will help the NHS?	Labour Party	not_statement
The Bill states that all transport services will be covered, but the industry is largely in the private sector.	Conservatives	not_statement
Does the Secretary of State expect, for example, self-employed cabbies to serve work notices to themselves?	Conservatives	not_statement
There seem to be a split here, too; I hear that the Transport Secretary has given rail companies permission for new pay offers, and we already know his views on minimum service levels.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Let us move on to education.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Will our overstretched headteachers be forced to write and serve work notices in their own staffrooms?	UK Government	not_statement
Does the Business Secretary agree with the Education Secretary that imposing these regulations on schools would be a hostile act?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Let us turn to fire and rescue services.	Conservatives	not_statement
Has austerity not already made it impossible for some services to meet existing contingency regulations as it is?	Conservatives	not_statement
Will the Business Secretary of State leave it there, or will he just go for broke and ban all key workers from joining a union at all?	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is something we know his desperate Prime Minister has been considering.	Labour Party	not_statement
Brendan Clarke-Smith (Bassetlaw) (Con) The right hon<prd> Lady mentions the issue of pay and speaking to unions to resolve this dispute.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
Can she tell us what level of pay she thinks, and the Labour Front-Bench team believe, is appropriate?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Would it be in line with inflation?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Would it be more than inflation?	Conservative Party	not_statement
How exactly would Labour solve this dispute?	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner I will just educate the hon<prd> Gentleman: although I used to be a trade union official and I am a member of a trade union, I do not negotiate on behalf of a trade union.	Labour Party	not_statement
But what I would do is sit around the table and resolve this dispute with the trade unions.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
That would be better than what the Conservatives have done.	Labour Party	not_statement
I come to the liability this Bill places upon trade unions.	Labour Party	not_statement
It says that trade unions must take “reasonable steps” to ensure workers comply with work notices, but what would they be?	Labour Party	not_statement
Will trade unions be liable for non-union staff?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
As for the burden put on employers, have they welcomed the bureaucratic nightmare that they will face?	Labour Party	not_statement
How will our already overstretched public services spare the resources to work out how many workers are needed to meet the minimum service levels the Secretary of State arbitrarily imposes on them, and to identify which workers should come into work and which should not?	Conservatives	not_statement
What will these bodies have to do?	Labour Party	not_statement
Will they have to do this before each and every strike day?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Paul Holmes (Eastleigh) (Con) I would like to try again on this, because the right hon<prd> Lady aspires to be Deputy Prime Minister and wants to negotiate with the unions in future.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Will she outline for the House, because the Labour party has been very quiet on this, whether she backs a 19% pay increase for nurses?	Conservative Party	not_statement
What costing has her party put forward as to how much she would award in pay rises to those public sector workers?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner What I can say is that the Labour party would not have crashed the economy like the Conservatives did.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We would not have inflation at the record levels we have at the moment.	Conservatives	not_statement
We would not have the disputes we have at the moment because we would negotiate with the trade unions and find a settlement.	Labour Party	not_statement
What protections are in place to prevent unscrupulous employers from targeting trade union members with work notices?	Labour Party	not_statement
Or is this legislation a licence for blacklisting?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
The Secretary of State is hiding behind warped misunderstandings of the International Labour Organisation’s statute book and misleading comparisons with Europe.	Labour and Co-op	not_statement
The ILO says that minimum service levels can happen only when the  “safety of individuals or their health is at stake”.	Conservatives	not_statement
Can he explain how that relates to the list of sectors in the Bill?	Labour Party	not_statement
Countries such as France and Spain may have minimum service levels, but they have not averted strikes there; both lose far more days to strike action than the UK.	Conservatives	not_statement
This Bill is a mess.	Labour Party	not_statement
It makes no sense.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It has more holes in it than the last Chancellor’s Budget, yet we are being given next to no time to scrutinise it.	Labour Party	not_statement
This legislation hands far-reaching powers to the Secretary of State to not just impose minimum service levels, but decide what those levels would be.	Labour Party	not_statement
The legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg has called clause 3  “a supercharged Henry VIII clause.	Labour Party	not_statement
”  Where is the consultation the Secretary of State promised?	Labour Party	not_statement
Where is the impact assessment?	Labour Party	not_statement
The Regulatory Policy Committee says, in a scornful statement today, that it has not even received it yet.	Conservative Party	not_statement
So why have the Government given only five hours for debate on the Floor of the House?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Let us look at what this Bill is really all about: a Government who are out of ideas, out of time and fast running out of sticking plasters; a Government who are playing politics with nurses’ lives because they cannot stomach negotiation; a Government desperately doing all they can to distract from the economic emergency they have caused.	Labour Party	not_statement
We have had 13 years of failure, and working people of this country cannot take any more.	Labour Party	not_statement
What this whole sorry episode makes clear is that this country needs a Labour Government.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Conservative party has proven itself incapable of cleaning up its own mess, and the disruption of the past few months simply would not be happening under Labour.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Neale Hanvey (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) (Alba) It is difficult to listen to the Secretary of State accuse workers who have devoted their lives to life saving, whether they are fire workers, doctors or nurses, of putting others at risk.	Conservatives	not_statement
As for the arguments that this is too expensive or too difficult, today Oxfam announced that $21 trillion went into the pockets of 1% internationally during the global pandemic.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Does the right hon<prd> Lady agree that there is enough money but it is just in the wrong pockets?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner The hon<prd> Gentleman makes some important and valid points.	Conservative Party	not_statement
In the past 12 months to two and a half years, we have seen the unravelling of the VIP fast-track lane for people linked to the Conservative party—that was a waste of billions of pounds that could have gone into investment in our public services.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The public have seen 13 years of Conservative failure.	Labour Party	not_statement
Most of the public who are watching this debate today can ask themselves one question: do they feel better off after 13 years of the Conservatives?	Labour Party	not_statement
The answer to that question is no, unless of course they are in that 1%, with a WhatsApp number of a Government Minister.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Labour would have resolved these disputes a long time ago, by getting back around the negotiating table in good faith and doing a deal.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Geraint Davies (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op) Is my right hon<prd> Friend aware that the Labour Government in Wales were given more than £1 billion for personal protective equipment and test, track and trace, and spent only £500 million?	Labour Party	not_statement
If we had had that level of savings, instead of having Tory crony donors putting their hand in the till, it would have aggregated up to a saving of £11 billion, as against a total pay cost to the NHS of £56 billion?	Labour Party	not_statement
In other words, we are talking about 20% of the annual pay for all nurses and all health workers.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
So does she not agree that if we had a Labour Government, we would have more money to provide decent wages for those in our health service?	Labour Party	not_statement
Angela Rayner I absolutely agree with my hon<prd> Friend; not only would we have grown the economy—and we have a plan to grow the economy, unlike the Conservatives —but we would not have wasted billions of pounds and we would not have crashed the economy like the Conservatives did.	Conservative Party	not_statement
This Government are not working and this Bill is unworkable.	Labour Party	not_statement
The sacking nurses Bill is one of the most indefensible and foolish pieces of legislation to come before this House in modern times.	Labour	not_statement
We on these Benches will vote against this shoddy, unworkable Bill, and I urge every Member across this House who cares for fundamental British freedoms, and who knows that the only way to resolve disputes is by negotiating in good faith, to join us in standing against it this evening.	Labour Party	not_statement
18:29:00  Priti Patel (Witham) (Con) It is a pleasure to follow the right hon<prd> Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner).	Conservative Party	not_statement
It was somewhat inevitable that this debate would quickly become partisan, and she reinforced that.	Labour Party	not_statement
I pay tribute to our hard-working frontline public sector workers.	Conservative Party	not_statement
On Friday, I visited workers at the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, who have not been on strike, and all credit to them.	Conservative Party	not_statement
In the operational control centres, people have been working diligently, day in, day out, to manage, quite frankly, the many, many challenging cases.	Conservative Party	not_statement
This House will understand my particular interest in operational frontline workers, especially when it comes to the police, who cannot strike, and also fire and rescue workers and Border Force officers.	Labour Party	not_statement
Just last year, I was able to use existing Home Office budgets to provide the police with a pay increase.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It was a 5% pay increase across the board and one of the largest settlements in the public sector.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I accepted the recommendation from the Police Remuneration Review Body, and it was my right hon<prd> Friend the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse), who is in his place, who oversaw that settlement.	Labour Party	not_statement
That funding was vital because we on the Conservative Benches believe in our frontline public sector workers.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We believe in giving them the resources that they need and the working conditions in which they can do their jobs, but within the affordability of the Government’s financial envelope, which is incredibly important.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Janet Daby (Lewisham East) (Lab) Is the right hon<prd> Lady aware that the Secretary of State’s own colleagues—the Secretaries of State for Transport and for Education—believe that the Bill will not solve the strikes?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Priti Patel I say to the hon<prd> Lady and to all Members in the House that we are facing fundamental economic challenges right now, and they have to be met within the financial envelope of this Government.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is a statement of the obvious.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We have seen that on our borders; border control is being weakened by strikes.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Patients and those in need of essential medical care are facing disruption.	Conservatives	not_statement
That is not right.	Conservative Party	not_statement
All of us have constituents.	Conservatives	not_statement
This is not about one constituency against another, or one part of the country against the other.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We have seen commuters who cannot get to work.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is wrong.	Labour Party	not_statement
Again, that is not right.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I know that many workers—I think that we all know this—find the decision to go out on strike very difficult.	Conservative Party	not_statement
They struggle when it comes to voting in ballots because of the options that are sometimes put in front of them.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We also know that there are some in the trade union movement—we must recognise this and we have heard it already from those on the Opposition Benches—who are happy to go along with the disruption, which is not acceptable.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Some get satisfaction out of this.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I am afraid that we have seen that in the past.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We have seen Opposition Members go on picket lines and cheer and make political points.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is not right, because, at the end of the day, it is the public who suffer.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Indeed, since 2010, we have seen the hard left and militants take action and co-ordinate strikes, and the public suffer.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
That is not right.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Let us not forget that it was the Conservatives who, in the 1980s, stood up to the militant trade unions, and, importantly, introduced reforms.	Conservatives	not_statement
Priti Patel I do not have time to give way.	Labour Party	not_statement
Priti Patel I cannot give way, because I do not have time.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Mr Deputy Speaker (Sir Roger Gale) I call the SNP spokesperson.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
18:35:00  Alan Brown (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (SNP) The right hon<prd> Member for Witham (Priti Patel) said that this was a partisan debate.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
Of course it is a partisan debate, because we either believe in the right of workers to strike or we do not, so, clearly, it is a partisan debate.	Conservatives	not_statement
She spoke about SMEs struggling because of strikes.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I can tell her that SMEs in my constituency are more worried about their energy bills going through the roof and the lack of Government support that is coming down the line from April onwards.	Labour Party	not_statement
We know that this is “anti-strike legislation”—those are not my words, but the words of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from the Dispatch Box last week at Scotland questions.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
He boasted that his Government were introducing “anti-strike” legislation in a rare bit of honesty from the Dispatch Box.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy keeps going on about minimum ambulance cover, but the reality is that this is an attack on millions of public sector workers.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The explanatory notes tell us that this is a Tory manifesto commitment about tackling transport strikes.	Labour Party	not_statement
Although the Conservatives might hide behind that manifesto commitment, that commitment has nothing to do with clamping down on the NHS or on teachers.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Conservatives claim that it is about safety, but, as I said earlier, the word “safety” is not used once in the Bill or in explanatory notes.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The reality is that this is an ideological war on the unions, which the Tories somehow think will curry favour with the public.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
It is a misty-eyed look back to Margaret Thatcher taking on the National Union of Mineworkers.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It was a battle that she won, but it was a battle that resulted in the closures of mines and left communities devasted and thousands of workers on the dole.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Do we really want to go back to sacking workers and putting them on the dole?	Labour Party	not_statement
That is what this is all about.	Labour Party	not_statement
We know that this is an ideological war, because, in this period of Tory governance, the Government have already given us the Trade Union Act 2016, introducing voting thresholds, and then, last year, the legislation to allow employers to hire agency staff to break strikes.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
There is no doubt that this Government want to end strikes, effectively removing the ultimate backstop on collective bargaining.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Bill not only facilitates an attack on workers, but enables employers to potentially sue unions for damages.	Labour Party	not_statement
It is no wonder that it is opposed by the TUC, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Unison, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing among others, and I certainly support them in opposing this.	Labour Party	not_statement
Neither the Scottish Government nor the Welsh Government want this legislation, but, yet again, this legislation will be imposed on the devolved nations.	Labour Party	not_statement
In Scotland, this is further proof that the Westminster straitjacket does us no good at all.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
We could have had employment and workers’ rights devolved, but, unfortunately, Labour resisted those powers coming to Scotland.	Labour Party	not_statement
However, even the STUC has now called for the devolution of employment rights to Scotland, so perhaps Labour should consider that, instead of listening to Gordon Brown’s rehash of broken promises.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
It is worth noting that the Bill does not impact Northern Ireland, as employment law is already devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, so, yet again, the so-called most powerful devolved Parliament in the world—the Scottish Parliament—has fewer powers than the Northern Ireland Assembly, and this proves it.	Labour Party	not_statement
This ideological attack comes from someone who, as Transport Secretary, was non-existent when it came to dialogue and communications, and that was confirmed by the unions.	Labour Party	not_statement
He was somebody who was blocking the DFT from agreeing deals, and now we have that same person in post leading the charge for anti-strike and anti-worker legislation.	Labour Party	not_statement
Given the Secretary of State’s form, we know that he is up for a fight, but even if wins this fight, he will be destroying worker relationships for good.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
These are hard-pressed workers, particularly from within the NHS, who are struggling at times with the pressures that they are under.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Who seriously thinks that not negotiating and threatening workers with the sack for striking will help matters?	Labour	not_statement
It is utterly insane.	Conservative Party	not_statement
As the rail unions pointed out at the Transport Committee last week, deals have been agreed where DfT and UK Ministers are not involved.	Labour Party	not_statement
Clearly the union asks cannot be too unreasonable, when RMT and ASLEF have agreed deals with ScotRail and the Scottish Government, deals in Wales and deals with Merseyrail, for example—deals with Governments and authorities that have been hamstrung by the Tory austerity imposed on them, yet still managed to agree deals.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Tories tell us they are the party of workers.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
That phrase fools no one, but they also tell us they are all about a high-wage, skilled economy.	Labour Party	not_statement
Yet, as we have heard, when workers ask for a wage rise they are told no, that it is unaffordable; even worse, in the case of the rail unions, the Secretary of State quotes figures that he thinks show how well paid all rail staff are.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is really telling: the Secretary of State is effectively saying, “Train drivers are overpaid—how dare they ask for a wage rise?	Liberal Democrats	not_statement
”.	Labour Party	not_statement
That is insulting beyond belief.	 productivity is flat	not_statement
The Tories can forget saying they want a high-wage economy.	Conservatives	not_statement
They were quite happy for the rail companies to pay dividends during the pandemic.	Conservative Party	not_statement
They were quite happy for Virgin Trains East Coast to walk away from the London North Eastern Railway franchise owing billions of pounds, but they always go for attacking workers.	Labour	not_statement
It is the same with the Secretary’s rhetoric about this legislation mirroring what happens elsewhere in Europe.	Labour	not_statement
His soundbites are easily proven to be false.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Indeed, the general secretary of the European Federation of Public Service Unions, Jan Willem Goudriaan, argued that comparison by the UK Government of this Bill with existing laws in other EU countries was misrepresenting the situation, because all minimum service levels in Europe are agreed through negotiation.	Conservatives	not_statement
Moreover, the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, Esther Lynch, said:  “The UK already has among the most draconian restrictions on the right to strike in Europe, and the UK government’s plans would push it even further away from normal, democratic practice across Europe”.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Pablo Sánchez Centellas, a spokesperson for the EPSU, was much more succinct, saying, “It’s bollocks.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
” The Secretary of State should reflect on the true position of this proposed legislation compared with what is happening in Europe.	Conservative Party	not_statement
He has also rightly pointed out that the human rights memorandum that accompanied the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill set out reasons why minimum service levels were not justified in fire services, health settings or education, yet that is what the Government now propose.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
By default, this Government are now going against their own previous human rights opinion.	Labour Party	not_statement
What kind of madness is that?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
When it comes to the International Labour Organisation, which the Secretary of State likes to reference, its idea of minimum service requirements is clearly intended to be based on endangerment to life, personal safety or health.	Labour Party	not_statement
This wide-ranging legislation goes way beyond those parameters.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
The ILO makes it clear there should be an independent arbitration body, yet this Bill is completely silent on such a body.	Labour	not_statement
Why is that?	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is also clear that any minimum service level is supposed to be just that—a bare minimum.	Conservatives	not_statement
We have no idea what this Government will railroad through via statutory instruments.	Labour Party	not_statement
Statutory instruments cannot be amended and the last time a Government was defeated on a statutory instrument was in 1979, so we know all power rests with the Government there.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
As Liberty has observed, the Bill does not create any form of minimal service.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Liberty also confirms that MPs debating this legislation on Second Reading will not know exactly what they are voting for, so all the Tory MPs in the Chamber who are going to take part in the debate and then trot through the Lobby will do so blind to what the future legislation and regulations on minimum service will look like.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
It is an affront to democracy.	Labour Party	not_statement
Any Tory MP who claims to care about parliamentary sovereignty cannot possibly vote for this Bill.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Bill is made worse by the Henry VIII power that allows amendment and revocation even of future legislation not yet passed.	Labour Party	not_statement
We can see how the Government are ramming this Bill through Parliament with minimum scrutiny and a proposed programme motion allowing just five hours for Committee.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
It really is an assault on democracy.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
The fact that the Bill comes into effect immediately once passed, so that work notices and actions can be taken by employers for strikes that have already been voted through, shows just how ridiculous this assault on workers is.	Labour Party	not_statement
The impact assessment for the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill observes that on a strike day in July 2022, 20% of rail services were still in operation.	Conservatives	not_statement
Right away that suggests to me that a minimum level of service was operating.	Conservative Party	not_statement
What do the Tories really think a minimum service is, if 20% is not a bare minimum?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
There are huge ramifications here for rail workers overall, because if this Government force through a high threshold of minimum service, strikes by signalmen and track operatives will effectively be banned.	Conservative Party	not_statement
A high minimum service will force all those guys to work to keep the tracks in operation and the trains running, effectively blocking strikes by the back door.	Conservatives	not_statement
What will minimum service look like for teachers?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Where does that fit in with all the talk about safety?	Labour Party	not_statement
What happens to train companies that cannot provide a minimum service at the moment, especially if union members decide not to work on their rest days and to work to rule?	Conservatives	not_statement
Where will that leave this Government on minimum service level obligations?	Conservatives	not_statement
The overview in the explanatory notes makes it clear that the ability to sack workers is a key aspect of the Bill.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
That is the polar opposite of what was said when a transport strike Bill was listed in the Queen’s Speech in December 2019, when it was stated that workers would not be discriminated against.	Labour Party	not_statement
Why are the Government now threatening people’s livelihoods?	Conservatives	not_statement
How can that be deemed acceptable?	 they should never be allowed to happen without consequences. The Bill makes it clear that such intimidation has no place in the modern workplace.,Conservative Party	not_statement
The sacking aspect is the proof that this is nothing to do with minimum cover by ambulance staff, as the Secretary of State likes to tell us.	Labour	not_statement
For fire services, the Secretary of State could also utilise the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, if he felt the desire to do so.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
It is crystal clear that this legislation is not required.	Labour Party	not_statement
It is an attack on democracy and the right to strike; it will prolong industrial disputes, not resolve them; it will allow individual workers to be targeted through work notices; and it is politically stupid.	Labour	not_statement
We have to wonder why this Tory Government are looking to antagonise something like 7 million workers across these sectors.	Labour Party	not_statement
The public can see through a Government who partied while clapping the nurses and now threaten them with the sack.	Labour	not_statement
They should follow the lead of the Scottish Government and get around the negotiating table.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The resolution of the ScotRail dispute has been commended by both the RMT and ASLEF.	Conservative Party	not_statement
There are no strikes planned in the health service in Scotland and the pay deal being implemented by the Scottish Government is one that the UK Government should replicate as a starting point when they get around the negotiating table.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
It is outrageous that the Scottish Government, who have been negotiating in good faith with the unions, will now have this legislation foisted upon them—legislation that Westminster could use to force work notices through in Scotland against the wishes of the Scottish Government and that could ruin otherwise good working relationships in Scotland.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Employment law should be devolved to Scotland, but even that would now just be a sticking plaster.	Labour Party	not_statement
It is perfectly obvious that what Scotland now needs is the full powers of a normal, independent country.	Conservatives	not_statement
Mr Deputy Speaker (Sir Roger Gale) I call the Chair of the Transport Committee.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
18:49:00  Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con) It is a pleasure to contribute to this debate as Chair of the Transport Committee, and I will focus my comments on that particular sector.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Let me say at the outset that I support the objective behind the Bill.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It does not strike me as unreasonable to seek a mechanism whereby the right of a worker to strike, which I have no quibble with, is balanced against the equally important right of an individual to go about their daily life, to travel to work, for healthcare, for education, to visit loved ones or for any of the millions of other reasons why people travel about.	Conservatives	not_statement
It is therefore appropriate to find a mechanism by which those two rights can be reconciled.	Conservative Party	not_statement
There are, however, a number of practical issues that I will put on the record.	Labour Party	not_statement
I understand that this is framework legislation and that the detail on how it will operate in the transport sector will follow.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I was heartened to hear that the consultation on the rail side of transport will be in place before the Bill completes its parliamentary passage.	Labour Party	not_statement
There are some issues that have to be clarified and resolved before the Bill can properly take effect.	Conservative Party	not_statement
As has already been alluded to, it is possible in rail, for example, for parts of the system to operate at a minimum level.	Conservative Party	not_statement
One train an hour could run from London to Manchester instead of three—there are a number of ways to have that reduction in service.	Conservative Party	not_statement
But some parts of the system are binary: a signal box is either open or closed; and in aviation, an air traffic control centre is either open or closed.	Conservatives	not_statement
We need clarity on where the minimum level of service will apply.	Conservatives	not_statement
A related point is whether every aviation, railway or bus line and service will have a minimum service or just a percentage of overall capacity.	Conservatives	not_statement
There is a trade-off to be made.	Conservative Party	not_statement
If another line operates nearby, does that mean that both lines have to operate a minimum service, or would one have a more regular service?	Labour	not_statement
Those are the trade-offs that will have to be made.	Conservative Party	not_statement
In the current dispute on the railways, Network Rail and the train operating companies have a degree of flexibility in making decisions on which lines and stations will be open.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Will what they have to cover now be specified in the regulations, or will they be left with some discretion?	Conservatives	not_statement
Dave Doogan (Angus) (SNP) Will the hon<prd> Member give way?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Iain Stewart If the hon<prd> Gentleman will forgive me, I have only a minute left and many Members wish to speak.	Conservative Party	not_statement
My last point is about what will be covered by the definition of “transport services”.	Conservative Party	not_statement
There are the traditional ones that we all assume will be covered—trains, buses, flights, ferries and the like—but what about some of the other modes of transport, such as cycle hire or taxi services?	Conservative Party	not_statement
What does the definition encompass?	Labour Party	not_statement
I will ask my Committee, when we meet later this week, if we can usefully contribute to the consultation, but I thought it would be helpful in this part of the debate to set out some of the questions that will have to be addressed as the Bill goes through.	Labour Party	not_statement
18:53:00  Darren Jones (Bristol North West) (Lab) I declare an interest as a member of Unite the union.	Conservative Party	not_statement
May I start by correcting the public record?	Conservative Party	not_statement
As always, I am grateful to Ministers for taking the time to speak with me directly about Bills in my capacity as Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Unfortunately, in a Westminster Hall debate on Thursday, the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the hon<prd> Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake), referenced our discussion without giving me advance notice.	Conservative Party	not_statement
He said that I was  “very supportive of a minimum service level”.	Conservatives	not_statement
—[Official Report, 12 January 2023; Vol.	Labour Party	not_statement
725, c.	Labour Party	not_statement
372WH.	Labour Party	not_statement
]  Let me be very clear to the House, to the Minister and to my constituents: I am against the Bill and will vote against it this evening.	Conservative Party	not_statement
What I said to the Minister was that I—and, I am sure, many people—think it reasonable for there to be a minimum level of service from our emergency services during a period of strike action, and I encouraged him to pursue that via discussion with the relevant services and trade unions, not by threatening them with the prospect of an effective statutory ban on their right to strike.	Conservatives	not_statement
When I asked the Minister whether he had sought to achieve that before introducing the legislation, he was unable to fully answer my question.	Labour Party	not_statement
As we have already heard this evening, the rationale for the Bill is therefore in question.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Government say that the legislation in place is not effective and that voluntary agreements cannot be sought, but that is not correct.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Indeed, in signing off the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill and its compliance with the European convention on human rights, even the Government said:  “In the case of other key public services, important factors exist to mitigate the impacts of industrial action”.	Conservatives	not_statement
So what has changed?	Conservative Party	not_statement
As we have already heard, section 240 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 makes it a criminal offence and a breach of employment contract to strike if doing so puts someone’s life in danger or puts them at risk of serious injury.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
That is why we have statutory guidance in place across public services, and it is why trade unions put life-and-limb service provision in place when they organise strikes with management.	Conservative Party	not_statement
On voluntary agreements, in December last year and this month, such agreements have been put in place.	Conservative Party	not_statement
As far as I am aware—from speaking with striking nurses at Southmead Hospital in my constituency, and later with senior management—there were no problems with those voluntary service arrangements, so the law is in place, voluntary agreements are in place, and there is no rationale for the Bill.	Labour Party	not_statement
We can therefore only conclude that it is a negotiating tactic—a threat—by the Government.	Labour Party	not_statement
Lastly, my Committee was disappointed by the lack of time for scrutinising the Bill.	Labour Party	not_statement
Once again, Ministers have introduced primary legislation with wide-ranging discretionary powers for Ministers without publishing the details of vital secondary legislation in a timely manner.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
That is unacceptable.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is poor practice for Ministers to bring legislation to the House in that way.	Labour Party	not_statement
As the Regulatory Policy Committee confirmed for me today, the Government are obliged to publish an impact assessment so that that Committee can inform the House of the impact of legislation proposed by Ministers.	Labour Party	not_statement
However, Ministers have not given the Regulatory Policy Committee the time to review the Government’s impact assessment and then inform the House about the consequences of the legislation.	Labour Party	not_statement
So not only do we have a Bill that has no evidence-based rationale for the need to legislate on voluntary agreements, but we have a Government rushing through the legislation without following due process and without drafting it to the standard that this House requires.	Labour Party	not_statement
It is clearly a rushed threat, it is unacceptable and it shows disregard for the House and the job that we have to do as parliamentarians to ensure that the law is passed effectively.	Conservative Party	not_statement
To summarise, can the Minister confirm that the Government will publish the statutory instruments and the impact assessment before the Bill finishes its passage through this House?	Labour Party	not_statement
I politely suggest that he may want to have another go at trying to explain to the House why the Bill is even necessary in the first place.	Conservative Party	not_statement
18:57:00  Saqib Bhatti (Meriden) (Con) I stand to speak in favour of the legislation and to commend the Government for taking this difficult but necessary step.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Today I want to talk about duty.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Through this legislation, we on the Conservative Benches are fulfilling our duty to protect our constituents.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Those on the Labour Benches—in hock to their trade union masters—are failing theirs.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Nurses, teachers, firefighters and all the other professions covered in the legislation are true heroes in our society.	Labour Party	not_statement
They carry out a great service to our communities.	Labour	not_statement
We must continue to focus on growing our economy to meet the wage demands of public sector workers, but we must also maintain the independence of pay review bodies precisely so that we can take the politics out of public sector pay.	Conservatives	not_statement
The conversation should also be about fairness and balancing the right to strike with the public’s right to be kept safe.	Conservatives	not_statement
We saw that with the Royal College of Nursing, which maintained a safe level of service.	Conservatives	not_statement
That just goes to show how selfless and professional those nurses where while exercising their democratic right, and I am grateful to them for protecting the public.	Labour Party	not_statement
I certainly hope that, in the next independent pay review, we reach a positive result and avoid future strike action.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The concept of minimum service levels is protected in article 11 of the ECHR and is endorsed by the International Labour Organisation.	Conservatives	not_statement
As we have already heard, this is no different from what is done in Italy, France and Spain.	Conservatives	not_statement
In that light, I find the position of the Labour party quite astonishing.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We all have a primary duty to protect our constituents and our communities.	Conservative Party	not_statement
By opposing the legislation, the Labour party is, in my view, failing in that duty.	Conservatives	not_statement
To be frank, Labour has supported the strikes, whether implicitly or explicitly.	Conservative Party	not_statement
At best, it has failed to take an appropriate stand against the trade unions; at worst, it is egging them on and relishing the disruption and division being caused.	Labour Party	not_statement
Is that what the modern Labour party stands for—closing down our schools, bringing our country to a standstill and threatening livelihoods?	Conservatives	not_statement
I know it is a new year, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is the same old Labour party.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
We on the Government Benches will not compromise on our fundamental duty.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We will do all we can to protect our constituents, our communities and our society.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is why I endorse the Bill.	Conservative Party	not_statement
19:00:00  Kate Osborne (Jarrow) (Lab) I direct the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests: I am a proud trade union member.	Conservatives	not_statement
Each of those power grabs commits political violence on our communities.	Conservatives	not_statement
Chris Loder (West Dorset) (Con) Will the hon<prd> Member give way?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Kate Osborne No.	Conservatives	not_statement
This Government are turning back the clock not just on workers’ rights but on the rights of the vast majority of this country.	Conservatives	not_statement
As always, Ministers are only concerned about making money for their cronies and big business.	Conservative Party	not_statement
My constituents have been in touch with me over the last few days to express how angry and disappointed they are at the Government’s handling of these disputes.	Conservative Party	not_statement
While I have time, I would rather say what my constituents want me to say than hear what Conservative Members want to say.	Conservative Party	not_statement
My constituent Robert Best from Boldon emailed me yesterday:  “The Government should be finding ways to help striking workers, rather than remove their right to strike!	Conservative Party	not_statement
Right now, refusing to negotiate with workers is the last thing our country needs.	Labour Party	not_statement
”  Robert is, of course, completely correct.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Workers need a pay rise, not a P45.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
Last week, in a question to the Business Secretary, I referenced the struggles of the Tolpuddle martyrs and the seven men of Jarrow—people who were criminalised 200 years ago for fighting for basic health and safety and pay.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The response I got was that I should stop “raving on”.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I will not stop raving on.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I will not stop supporting workers and the people in my community.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Kevin Hollinrake) I am grateful to the hon<prd> Member for giving way.	Labour Party	not_statement
Will she point out where there are any criminal sanctions attached to the proposed legislation?	Labour Party	not_statement
As far as I can see, there are absolutely none.	Labour Party	not_statement
It is important that we do not scaremonger in that way.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Kate Osborne The Government’s proposed legislation and the response I just got show the contempt in which they hold working people.	Conservatives	not_statement
The Government do not care about working people.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
They do not care about our communities who are struggling to survive in the face of unaffordable food and energy bills, and struggling to deal with the cost of living crisis and 13 years of cuts by the Conservative party.	Liberal Democrats	not_statement
We already have the most restrictive workers’ rights in western Europe, and it is an affront to democracy that this Government are trying to restrict them further.	Labour Party	not_statement
Of course, the Government know that the Bill is not workable.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It will be held up in the other place, if it gets that far, and in the courts.	Conservative Party	not_statement
They only care about attention-grabbing headlines—about moving the Overton window so the people of this country will accept more and more restrictions on their rights.	Labour Party	not_statement
Minimum service levels already exist: our NHS teams ensure that priority calls are dealt with, and teachers ensure that special educational needs children are catered for.	Labour	not_statement
What we need is for the Government to provide a minimum service level every day.	Conservatives	not_statement
We hear daily of workers struggling to cope with current staffing levels.	Conservatives	not_statement
The Government should be looking at ways to address the NHS staffing crisis, not making it worse.	Labour	not_statement
The Government need to accept that the reason so many sectors are saying “enough is enough” and taking industrial action—we heard the announcement today that the teaching unions will take action, and I send my solidarity to them—is the Government’s failures.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The firefighters, NHS staff, transport staff and education staff that the Bill targets are the very people who saw us through the pandemic.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
If the Bill passes, no doubt the Government will eventually seek to apply the legislation to workers in more sectors.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Instead of inflaming the situation, they should start dealing with the causes of increased strike action: low wages, fuel and food poverty, and cuts to public services.	Conservatives	not_statement
As I said at the start, it is an act of political violence.	Conservatives	not_statement
The Government should do the right thing for the country and withdraw it.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
19:05:00  Dr Ben Spencer (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con) We have had so much disruption to our critical services in recent years, and I pay tribute to all those working in those sectors.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I support minimum service levels for our critical services.	Conservatives	not_statement
Who could oppose them?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Well, the Labour party does.	Labour Party	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but does that not ignore the rights of all of those who rely on these key services for their health, their education and their livelihood?	Conservative Party	not_statement
We have seen the sad impact on pupils of disruption to education, the extra burden it places on families and schools, and the anxiety that causes parents and students.	Conservatives	not_statement
The Children’s Commissioner highlighted this weekend that it is the most disadvantaged who face the greatest impact if education is disrupted.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I support the right of children to a great education, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but that ignores the rights of working families and students if schools close.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Minimum service levels should also apply to our ambulance service.	Conservatives	not_statement
We all know the challenges our NHS is facing, yet at a time when we need to focus on addressing them, Labour opposes minimum service levels for our ambulance and fire services.	Conservatives	not_statement
Does anyone really believe it should be up to intransigent unions to decide whether help arrives?	Labour Party	not_statement
Emergency services should not be a bargaining chip in employment disputes.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Our country cannot be held to ransom by intransigent unions.	Labour Party	not_statement
I believe the NHS should be there when we need it, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	Conservatives	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but what about the right to receive care in an emergency?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
The rail strikes are yet another example.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I have been contacted by constituents whose children are unable to get to school, commuters unable to get to work, and patients unable to see their loved ones in hospital or go to appointments.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I support everyone’s right to travel, but the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights, but what about the rights of the self-employed?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Are they not workers?	Labour Party	not_statement
What about the rights of small business employees?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Are they not workers?	Labour Party	not_statement
What about the rights of drivers?	Labour Party	not_statement
Are they not workers?	Labour Party	not_statement
What about cleaners, administrators or carers—or any worker in a sector not supported by unions?	Labour Party	not_statement
I was elected to this House to represent all my constituents, and that means protecting health services, education and livelihoods.	Conservative Party	not_statement
In the light of union intransience to negotiate and modernise, minimum service levels are now needed, so I wholeheartedly support the Bill.	Conservatives	not_statement
I am genuinely appalled that the Labour party opposes minimum service levels.	Conservatives	not_statement
It says it is protecting workers’ rights.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I think we all know who it is really protecting.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
19:08:00  Vicky Foxcroft (Lewisham, Deptford) (Lab) Let me start by declaring an interest: I am a proud member of both Unite the union and GMB and, prior to being elected to this place, I worked for Unite the union for over a decade.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Contrary to what some Conservative Members may have us believe, trade unions want their workplaces to thrive.	Labour Party	not_statement
They know that a productive workplace needs a happy, motivated workforce.	Labour Party	not_statement
They know that, when companies make large profits, they can ask for decent pay rises for their members.	Labour Party	not_statement
When workplaces struggle, they will work with the employer to ensure it survives.	Labour Party	not_statement
We all know how public sector workers kept our country moving during the pandemic.	Labour	not_statement
They worked night and day to keep us safe, but how does this Government seek to repay them?	Conservatives	not_statement
First, with a derisory pay offer and then— because the unions have voted to strike, rather than roll over and accept the derisory pay offer—the Prime Minister has resorted to launching a fundamental attack on workers’ freedoms.	Labour Party	not_statement
This Bill is unworkable and impractical.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Between 2010 and 2020, France lost almost six times as many days to strikes as the UK, and Spain lost more than twice as many.	Labour and Co-op	not_statement
Ironically, we already have minimum service levels in place in the UK.	Conservatives	not_statement
I remember when I joined a picket line with striking firemen and women, and they told me how they had agreed with their employer that, if there was any fire or any other emergency, they would jump into the fire engines and be straight there.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
None of them wanted to see anyone lose their lives because of their action, which was their last resort.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Most worryingly, the Bill does not give any indication of what will constitute a minimum level of service, meaning that the Secretary of State will be able to change that at their discretion.	Labour Party	not_statement
Having stretched public services and the workforce to breaking point, the Government’s solution is to create conditions in which workers can be forced into work and are unable to withhold their labour, no matter what the employee does.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Is that really the kind of Britain of which we want to be part—one in which workers’ freedoms are being restricted to the extent that they could be sacked for standing up for their rights?	Labour Party	not_statement
Chris Loder What would the hon<prd> Lady say to those members of the RMT who decided to come back to work before Christmas because they did not agree with what the union was doing?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Vicky Foxcroft That is democracy.	Labour Party	not_statement
Trade unions are subject to the most vigorous legislation when they are balloting and trade union money is the cleanest money in politics.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Public sector workers are proud of the role they play in society, saving and protecting lives, but they need to be valued and their voices matter.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
When our NHS workers say they are worried about public health and the NHS, we need to listen, not curtail the right for their voices to be heard.	Conservatives	not_statement
The Government could and should have negotiated with the trade unions to get a decent settlement.	Labour Party	not_statement
They need to listen closely to the concerns that workers across the country have been raising.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I thoroughly believe that, when we work together, we achieve better outcomes.	Labour Party	not_statement
I defend their right to strike and I will be voting against this Bill.	Conservative Party	not_statement
19:13:00  Laura Farris (Newbury) (Con) I would like to accept the invitation of the shadow Deputy Prime Minister, the right hon<prd> Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner), who encouraged us to be respectful in this debate.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I wish to be so.	Conservatives	not_statement
We have heard a lot from the Labour party this evening about how the Bill is an act of political violence and an attack on the fundamental freedom of working people, but we have not heard an answer to the fundamental question that the legislation poses: do the British people have a right set out in statute to a basic safety and security guarantee during periods of strike?	Labour Party	not_statement
Let us start with the law.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Joanna Cherry The hon<prd> Lady asks whether any of us on the Opposition Benches care about fundamental safety levels, and yes we do.	Conservative Party	not_statement
She asked whether we would support legislating, but legislation already exists.	Labour Party	not_statement
On article 11, she knows as well as I do that the measures have to be “necessary”.	Conservatives	not_statement
The Government’s own memo with the last legislation said that the measures were not necessary in relation to the health service, education and fire and rescue.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Laura Farris I thank the hon<prd> and learned Lady for her point, and I will assist her, because I was coming on to that point.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The article 11 right may be restricted for two reasons—if the restriction is necessary, yes, and proportionate.	Conservatives	not_statement
The International Labour Organisation, of which the United Kingdom is a founding member, recognises that maintaining a minimum level of service provision can be both when it comes to essential services.	Conservatives	not_statement
Its committee on freedom of association has expressly set out the two circumstances in which it may be appropriate: where strike action would pose a risk to life, safety or health; or where the service is not essential in the strict sense of the word, but where repeated strikes would bring a very important sector to a standstill.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Chris Stephens The ILO also says, does it not, that the minimum service level has to be agreed by an independent arbiter if there is a dispute, which is not in the Bill, and that there should not be a dismissal, which is in the Bill?	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Laura Farris I am grateful to both SNP Members for their interventions.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I am coming on to those points, so I will make a tiny bit of progress, if I may.	Conservative Party	not_statement
On the point raised by the hon<prd> and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry), we already know that transport and education meet the ILO’s test, because the ILO told the United Kingdom that in its response to the challenge to the Trade Union Act 2016 submitted by the TUC in 2015.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
In its response, the ILO committee of experts—Members can look it up; it is on the website—said that in relation to transport and education  “recourse might be had to negotiated minimum standards for these sectors as appropriate”.	Labour Party	not_statement
We also know that many comparable countries take a much tougher line than the Government are proposing.	Labour Party	not_statement
In the United States, to give one example, 38 out of 50 states ban public sector strikes altogether.	Conservatives	not_statement
Barry Gardiner (Brent North) (Lab) The hon<prd> Lady is presenting a reasoned case, but she knows, and she has just used the word, that these things should be negotiated.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The measures in this Bill are by fiat of the Secretary of State.	Labour Party	not_statement
Laura Farris I thank the hon<prd> Gentleman for his point.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I am coming to all these things, so if he will give me a moment, I will continue.	Labour Party	not_statement
In the United States, 38 out of 50 states have an outright ban on public sector strikes, including New York.	Conservatives	not_statement
Other states, such as Canada, Australia, Italy and Spain, all have embedded in statute minimum service levels that apply to important public services, and those services are often drawn much more widely than the Government are proposing.	Conservatives	not_statement
They include waste collection, postal services, broadcast services, the administration of justice, water distribution and energy supply.	Labour Party	not_statement
I pick out those states not as random examples, but because every single one is a member of the International Labour Organisation.	Conservatives	not_statement
They are bound by exactly the same rules as us, and they are among our closest comparators around the world.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Even more importantly, the International Labour Organisation has adjudicated all their statutory minimum service levels, and a 2019 publication from the ILO in Geneva commented:  “These examples illustrate the wide diversity of approach that ILO member states have adopted to address the challenges posed by industrial disputes in essential services”.	Conservatives	not_statement
Minimum service levels  “supported by the ILO’s supervisory organs, exist to manage the balancing act between these necessary restrictions and the individual worker’s fundamental labour rights”.	Labour	not_statement
I have not heard a single Member of Parliament tonight explain to me why the ILO is wrong or why the Government are striking the wrong balance when they have a mandate for what they are doing.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Sam Tarry (Ilford South) (Lab) For example, the ILO imposes restraints on the circumstances in which such powers can be used, which is the antithesis of the Government’s blank cheque approach.	Labour Party	not_statement
Laura Farris With respect to the hon<prd> Gentleman, I take the opposite position.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The United States has an outright ban on public service strikes in 38 states.	Conservatives	not_statement
In December, President Biden made his most recent intervention in union rights when he signed legislation that imposed an outright ban on a national railroad strike.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The United States is a founder member, as we are, of the International Labour Organisation.	Conservatives	not_statement
It goes much further, but the ILO has found its ban to be lawful.	Conservative Party	not_statement
19:20:00  Dawn Butler (Brent Central) (Lab) A lot of time is spent in courts in some countries arguing about minimum service level agreements.	Conservatives	not_statement
I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I am a proud trade unionist: I worked for the GMB for more than a decade representing Members of Parliament, I am a member of Unite the union, and, after this debate, I might join a few more trade unions.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Secretary of State took great joy in reading out how much hon<prd> Members receive from trade unions, which is, as my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Vicky Foxcroft) said, the cleanest money in politics.	Labour Party	not_statement
I wonder if, when he returns to his place, he will let the House know how much Michael Green, Corinne Stockheath and Sebastian Fox have received in payments.	Conservative Party	not_statement
In the short time that I have, I will talk about the Bill.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is dishonest; it is an insult to trade unions, which are the aspirational vehicle of the working class; and it is an insult to Parliament and parliamentary procedures.	Labour Party	not_statement
Most of the detail of the Bill is missing and the Government have said that they will add it later—that is not how we are supposed to do politics or make legislation.	Labour Party	not_statement
It allows the Government to amend and revoke any future legislation passed in this Session, so what is the point of Parliament?	Conservative Party	not_statement
No matter what we say or pass, the Government can turn around and say, “We want to change it,” or, “We want to revoke it.	Conservative Party	not_statement
” That is against what every single Member of Parliament has been elected to do.	Conservative Party	not_statement
When I was a trade union official, it said on our office wall, “To make rich people work harder, they pay them more.	Labour Party	not_statement
To make poor people work harder, they try to pay them less.	Conservative Party	not_statement
” Safety does not appear anywhere in the Bill.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
The House of Lords debated a report, “Democracy Denied?	Labour Party	not_statement
”, which said that we must rebalance power between Parliament and the Executive.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Government are asking Parliament to vote on a Bill that does not really exist, because there is no detail.	Labour Party	not_statement
They are interested in trying to paint trade unions, which are the aspirational vehicle of the working class, in one light and themselves in another.	Labour	not_statement
19:24:00  Chris Loder (West Dorset) (Con) It is a pleasure to speak in the debate.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I start by declaring that I am not a member of GMB, Unite the union or Unison—I apologise to Opposition Members if I have missed one out.	Conservative Party	not_statement
My remarks relate to the transport industry, as I worked for the railways for 20 years before I was elected; indeed, I was previously a member of two trade unions.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I warmly welcome this important Bill.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Those of us who are, and have been, sensible and constructive trade union members know that we can still take strike action without closing down the whole network or shutting down an entire operation.	Conservative Party	not_statement
[Interruption.	Labour	not_statement
] I hear the moans of Opposition Members, but union members are fed up of being used as political pawns, which is why the strikes are breaking across the railway today.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Individual members and individual areas are saying, “No.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
Enough is enough.	UK Government	not_statement
”  Florence Eshalomi Will the hon<prd> Gentleman give way?	Labour Party	not_statement
Sam Tarry Will the hon<prd> Gentleman give way?	Labour Party	not_statement
Chris Loder I am sorry; I will not give way to hon<prd> Members, because I have to crack on.	Labour Party	not_statement
These strikes are not a new or recent development.	Conservative Party	not_statement
There have been constant strikes for more than six months among some groups and, in some locations, they have actually been going on for years.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We are seeing a rampant appetite for industrial action.	Conservatives	not_statement
We know that is the case, because RMT members have been striking against themselves in the last 12 months.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Last week, at the Transport Committee, it became clear that the head of the train drivers’ union not only is a Labour party member, but has a top seat on its executive ruling body.	Conservative Party	not_statement
There is a close relationship between the Labour party and the trade unions, which is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to individual Opposition MPs.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Sam Tarry I thank the hon<prd> Gentleman for giving way and for being honest about his trade union membership.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Chris Loder I remind the hon<prd> Gentleman that my remarks are about those in the transport industry who are in touch with me and those who represent them.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I should say, however, that no teachers in my constituency have been in touch with me to tell me that.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
The Opposition should take note of that.	Labour Party	not_statement
I will bring my remarks to a close.	Labour Party	not_statement
As I was saying, the relationship between the unions and individual Opposition Members is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The unions are showering the Opposition with hundreds of thousands—millions—of pounds as if it were confetti from the sky.	Labour	not_statement
It is absolutely outrageous.	Conservatives	not_statement
We have the privilege of being able to refer to the Register of Members’ Financial Interests when they speak in this House—that is all it takes.	Labour Party	not_statement
[Interruption.	Labour	not_statement
] It is all there; I assure hon<prd> Members that there is no influence from trade unions in my entry.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The irony is that we know that Opposition Front-Bench Members have accepted the TUC’s invitation to go to Spain to talk about such things with Spanish unions and to work out how disruption can be caused in this country.	Conservative Party	not_statement
There is so much to expose, but I am afraid that I do not have any time left, otherwise I would be happy to say more.	Conservative Party	not_statement
19:29:00  Owen Thompson (Midlothian) (SNP) It looks like being quite the week for the use of draconian anti-democratic powers by this Government.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Turning their backs on the fundamental tenets of democracy really is something this Government are getting far too used to doing.	Labour Party	not_statement
The more they get a taste for it, the further they want to go.	Labour Party	not_statement
We saw the attack on devolution through the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020, and now we see them block a democratic decision rightly taken in Holyrood, cranking up the disrespect yet another notch.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
We see their anti-protest laws becoming even more authoritarian, with plans for the police to arrest campaigners before they even have a chance to commit a crime, and now we have their anti-trade union agenda being taken to the next level with these blunt powers being brought forward to stop strikes.	Labour Party	not_statement
The sweeping Henry VIII powers in the Bill, enabling Ministers to amend, repeal or revoke primary legislation not yet passed, should chill the heart of any democrat.	UK Government	not_statement
It is ironic that a Government so keen to turn their back on Europe lean so heavily on their excuse, “But that is what other countries do”.	Conservatives	not_statement
It is also deeply disingenuous, and as Unison has rightly pointed out, countries being cherry-picked by the Government, such as Italy and France, come to voluntary agreements through collaborative processes and have far less restrictive measures in place than we currently see in the UK.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Strikes are not the cause of the problems we face here; they are a symptom of the deep-rooted damage that has been done to our public service by this Government.	Labour Party	not_statement
The fact is that nobody downs tools without very good cause, especially during a cost of living crisis.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Whatever motivation workers may have, they are under attack on all fronts by this Government, and I commend the unions for taking action to protect their members.	Labour Party	not_statement
If the Government continue to be determined to go down this destructive path, further damaging industrial relations, they must devolve employment law now, so that the Scottish Government have the powers they need to protect the rights of the people of Scotland from the damage of this Government.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Workers are not just striking for themselves.	Labour	not_statement
This Bill should be refused any further consideration, and I urge every Member here tonight to stand against it and vote it down.	Labour Party	not_statement
Mr Deputy Speaker (Sir Roger Gale) I call Gagan Mohindra.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
19:32:00  Mr Gagan Mohindra (South West Hertfordshire) (Con) May I first welcome you to your place, Mr Deputy Speaker?	 know whether you have already voted	not_statement
I place on record my thanks to all public sector workers for the excellent work they have done—not just during the pandemic, but for many years prior to it.	Labour Party	not_statement
As we all know, the country is facing a difficult period of economic hardship.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Yes, it is partly because of the war in Ukraine, and yes, it is partly because of our active response in the fight against the pandemic, but we need to be conscious that we are here to support workers, and not all workers are members of unions.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
As many Members will know—I have said this in this place before—while I represent quite a lovely constituency, public transport very much runs north and south, and when there are rail strikes, my constituents can get around only with extreme difficulty.	Conservative Party	not_statement
While that may not necessarily hurt those who have the ability to access a car or, in extremis, pay for a little cab, those who we should be supporting the most are actually the ones most affected by this—the ones who are not able to use the bus to send their kids off to school or to get to their GP surgery for a doctor’s appointment.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Reference has been made to the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, which I know has had a really tough time over many years.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I would like to place on record my thanks that it was not one of the bodies that had a strike over recent weeks.	Labour Party	not_statement
Unfortunately, I have had to use its services over the last few weeks and months, and I know that it is literally saving lives in doing the excellent work it does in very difficult circumstances.	Conservatives	not_statement
One of the things I want to make the public aware of is that, post pandemic, we have adapted the way we work.	Labour Party	not_statement
Yes, we are very supportive of people such as rail workers, but the general population will adapt.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I am a firm believer that we should be encouraging people to get back to work, which may mean commuting to London, as it does for a lot of my constituents.	Labour Party	not_statement
However, if that proves too difficult, they will just turn around and say, “Actually, we’ve already adapted, post pandemic, to working from home”.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That means we will hollow out the urban areas of our country such as central London, where instead of a vibrant high street, as we have had with Victoria Street, we will very quickly have high street retailers, such as the Pret A Mangers of the world, closing up shop because they do not have the footfall to support them.	Labour Party	not_statement
Reference has been made to international comparisons.	Labour	not_statement
I for one think we have got the balance right with our support for workers, but also, counter to that, for wealth creators.	Conservative Party	not_statement
As someone who comes from a small and medium-sized enterprise background, I know that I was fully reliant on one, two or three workers in, in my case, a furniture retail shop, to make sure the business could run, and I could not have done it without them.	Conservatives	not_statement
They were not part of a union, but 80% of our economy is reliant on SMEs, so while unions are excellent in the work they do for large public sector bodies, other workers out there are not members of a union.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Mr Deputy Speaker Order.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
19:36:00  Sarah Owen (Luton North) (Lab) I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests and declare that I am proudly a trade union member, as will be no surprise to anybody.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I will save the Secretary of State, who is no longer in his place, time and say that the donation to me three years ago was actually my final month’s salary from the GMB.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I would rather have clean donations from trade unions any day over anything that the Conservative party receives from non-doms.	Labour Party	not_statement
The attacks on the rights and freedoms of our constituents are only becoming more apparent.	Labour Party	not_statement
We are all desperate for our public services to be stronger, faster, more effective and cost-efficient, but it is not the fault of the selfless and hard-working key workers in our health, rail and teaching sectors that public services are in the skeletal state they are or that nurses are having to use food banks.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
It is the fault of 13 years of Tory Governments.	Labour Party	not_statement
As for many others in this Chamber, the prosperity of public services and their workforce is personal for me.	Labour Party	not_statement
I was care worker, I worked in the fire brigade and I was a healthcare assistant doing shifts in hospitals.	Labour Party	not_statement
I have also been a trade union member for nearly 20 years, and I have been a trade union officer working on pro-manufacturing campaigns, bereavement leave for foster carers, stopping the abuse of agency workers, training airport staff and ensuring survivors of domestic abuse are safe at work.	Labour Party	not_statement
I say this not because it is particularly extraordinary, but because this is all in a day’s work for trade unionists, and Conservative Members should bear that in mind while they denigrate the work of trade unions.	Conservative Party	not_statement
This is not just political; it is also personal.	Labour Party	not_statement
My partner works in education, while my father was a firefighter and my mother was a nurse.	Labour Party	not_statement
They took great pride in their work, and so they should.	Conservative Party	not_statement
When we face crises personally or nationally, it is these workers we rely on to keep us safe, to heal us, and to protect our homes and our loved ones.	Conservatives	not_statement
Why then are this Government determined to punish those workers with real-terms pay cuts, job losses, worse terms and uncertain futures, yet still reward bankers with unlimited bonuses?	Labour Party	not_statement
Not only are British public service workers seeing their pay declining or their jobs cut, they are now told that they cannot speak up about it.	Conservatives	not_statement
The message to public sector heroes from this Bill is: “Put up and shut up”.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Unfortunately for this Government, that is not the spirit of this country or of the party of these Benches.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Our constituents know the value of their work, and they know the dignity they deserve.	Conservatives	not_statement
When it comes to civil liberties, oh, the Conservatives talk a good game about freedom of speech, but on the basic rights to strike and to protest, this Government—one of the most extreme Tory Governments—are on the wrong side every time.	Labour Party	not_statement
They fight for the rights of holocaust deniers, climate change sceptics, and out-and-out misogynists to say whatever they like online, in an effort to appear anti-woke and pro-freedom of speech, yet when it comes to the freedoms of nurses, teachers, doctors, paramedics, firefighters, support staff and healthcare assistants, the Conservatives are not on their side, and they do not want them to have the same freedoms as everyone else.	Labour Party	not_statement
Ordinary working people such as the ones Ministers are now trying to gag fought for our rights—the right to maternity leave and bank holidays, the right to be safe at work and have equal pay, and the right to remove our labour.	Conservatives	not_statement
The right for people to have their voices heard when those in power are not listening.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Time and again, the Tories show that they are on the wrong side.	Labour Party	not_statement
All they have to do is listen and negotiate.	Labour	not_statement
They are the reason why people need strong trade unions and a Labour Government, because the Tories will never be on the side of working people.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I will always be on the side of working people, and I will vote against the Bill today.	Conservative Party	not_statement
19:40:00  Ruth Edwards (Rushcliffe) (Con) That is what we are talking about.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Bill is not about views on the rights and wrongs of the current strikes.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
I deeply value the work of nurses, teachers, firefighters, ambulance drivers and rail staff across Rushcliffe and the country, and of course they should have the right to withdraw their labour.	Labour	not_statement
The Bill is about how they can do so safely.	Labour Party	not_statement

Government amendments 262 and 263.	Labour Party	not_statement
Justin Madders I start by referring to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests, as I have done throughout the passage of the Bill.	UK Government	not_statement
I thank Members in all parts of the House for their valuable contributions throughout the passage of the Bill to date, and in particular my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Llanelli (Dame Nia Griffith) for her assistance in taking the Bill through Committee, and the other members of the Public Bill Committee for providing substantial debate and scrutiny.	Conservative Party	not_statement
It is therefore important that we get the detail right.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The amendments being put forward by the Government directly demonstrate our commitment to full and comprehensive consultation on the detail of the plan to make work pay.	Labour Party	not_statement
On 4 March, we published five consultation responses relating to key areas of the Bill.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That package represents the first phase of formal public consultations on how best to put our plans into practice.	Labour Party	not_statement
We have also undertaken extensive engagement with more than 150 stakeholder organisations, in addition to the formal consultations.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We have made great efforts to listen to the range of views from businesses, trade unions, representative organisations, civil society and others.	UK Government	not_statement
The insights gained have been invaluable in informing the amendments to ensure the Bill works in practice, both for workers and for businesses of all sizes across the whole country.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The amendments will strengthen the Bill, providing further detail and clarity on measures and ensuring such measures can be implemented in a straightforward way.	Labour Party	not_statement
I turn to the detail of the amendments.	Labour	not_statement
What is the answer?	Labour Party	not_statement
Justin Madders The answer is in the Department’s press release, which cites Simon Deakin, professor of law at the University of Cambridge, no less.	Labour Party	not_statement
He has said:  I am sure that the right hon<prd> Member wants to see that happen.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Liam Byrne (Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North) (Lab) The Minister will have seen the appalling evidence that the Business and Trade Committee took from McDonald’s, where the BBC investigation exposed allegations from hundreds of young workers who were suffering harassment, and even allegations from one worker of managers soliciting them for sex in return for scheduling shifts.	Labour	not_statement
Justin Madders I thank the Chairman of the Select Committee for his question.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We are aiming to work on this once the Bill has passed this stage, and consultation will take place in due course.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I have to say that the chuntering from those on the Conservative Benches really shows how they fail to appreciate the power imbalance that there is in some workplaces and the exploitation and harassment that arise from that.	Labour Party	not_statement
Many agency workers have a preference for guaranteed hours, according to survey evidence.	Labour	not_statement
We know that 55% of agency workers requested a permanent contract with their hirer between January 2019 and September 2020, according to the Department for Business and Trade’s agency worker survey.	Labour	not_statement
Given the important role that agency work plays in businesses and public services, we recognise the need to work with the recruitment sector, employers and trade unions to design detailed provisions for regulations that work—that is,  The Government have also tabled amendments in relation to dismissal and redundancy practices.	Labour	not_statement
Sir Ashley Fox (Bridgwater) (Con) I had the good fortune to serve with the Minister for 21 sessions in Committee, and at the end of that we had a Bill 192 pages long.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We now have 270 pages of amendments, most of which come from the Government.	Labour Party	not_statement
Why are they tabling so many amendments and giving them just two days’ scrutiny?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Are these just more union demands?	Conservatives	not_statement
Justin Madders I have literally just explained how we have been consulting with businesses and trade unions and put down amendments as a result.	Labour Party	not_statement
Of course, if the hon<prd> Member is concerned about the length of the amendment paper, he can withdraw his own amendment, which we will no doubt be debating later on.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We are tabling some technical amendments to clause 21 on unfair dismissal that will update cross-references in other legislation to “the sum”, which is the existing cap on the compensation that can be awarded by an employment tribunal in most unfair dismissal cases.	Labour Party	not_statement
13:45:00 We have listened to feedback from business on the clause as introduced, which required consultation whenever 20 or more redundancies were proposed to be made across an employer’s organisation.	Labour Party	not_statement
Businesses told us that this would have put them in a constant state of consultation, The amendment means that collective redundancy obligations will be triggered where 20 or more redundancies are proposed at one establishment, in line with the existing law, or the number of proposed redundancies across the organisation meets a certain threshold.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Government will set this threshold out in due course via secondary legislation.	Conservative Party	not_statement
This could be a proportion of employees in a business, a suitable number of employees across a business, or some other threshold proposed through detailed consultation.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Employers will also be required to notify the Government of redundancies that meet the threshold set in secondary legislation.	Conservatives	not_statement
New clause 34 will therefore double the protective award an employment tribunal can make from 90 to 180 days.	Conservative Party	not_statement
We consulted on this and other matters from October to December 2024, and after listening carefully to a range of responses from businesses and employee representatives, we have concluded that the maximum period of the protective award an employment tribunal can make should be raised from 90 to 180 days.	Conservative Party	not_statement
This is on top of changes that the Government have already made.	Labour Party	not_statement
From 20 January this year, employment tribunals have had the ability to uplift the protective award by up to 25% where an employer unreasonably failed to follow the code of practice on dismissal and re-engagement.	Labour Party	not_statement
We recognise that responsible employers up and down the country already go further than their current obligations to collectively consult and will continue to do so.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Government are also tabling amendments in relation to the Bill’s provisions on flexible working and dismissal during pregnancy.	Labour Party	not_statement
Clause 22 adds a new power to make provisions for non-redundancy dismissals during or after the protected period of pregnancy.	Labour Party	not_statement
The amendments will add supplementary provisions to this power.	Labour Party	not_statement
We will work with stakeholders on how to exercise these powers in regulations.	Labour Party	not_statement
Amendment 79 to clause 7 proposes that the flexible working measures in the Bill be added to those provisions in scope of section 202 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.	Labour	not_statement
That means that the security services—MI5, GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service—will be exempt from disclosing any information related to flexible working requests if, in the opinion of a Minister, it would be contrary to national security.	Labour Party	not_statement
In those instances, the employer would not need to disclose the reasons for refusing a request.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Government are moving amendments on statutory sick pay.	Labour Party	not_statement
We launched a public consultation that asked employers, employees, trade unions, stakeholders and members of the public what percentage rate that should be.	Labour Party	not_statement
Today’s amendments will set the rate of statutory sick pay at 80% of an employee’s normal weekly earnings or the flat rate—whichever is lower.	Labour Party	not_statement
Consequently, we will remove the previously proposed power for the Secretary of State to prescribe the percentage rate in secondary legislation.	Labour Party	not_statement
However, Ministers will still be able to use the existing power in section 157 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to substitute a different provision as to the weekly flat rate of SSP, or the percentage rate of the employee’s weekly earnings, depending on which is lower.	Labour Party	not_statement
The amendments also amend the weekly flat rate to £118<prd>75, as agreed by Parliament as part of its annual uprating exercise.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Government are moving amendments that will add two new provisions into part 2 of the Bill.	Labour Party	not_statement
Analysis conducted by the Resolution Foundation found that 900,000 workers reported that they had no paid holiday despite that being a day one entitlement.	Conservative Party	not_statement
New clause 35 will create a new duty in the Working Time Regulations 1998 for employers to retain records relating to holiday pay and annual leave for six years.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Sir Alec Shelbrooke (Wetherby and Easingwold) (Con) I apologise if the Minister has moved on a bit; I was just waiting to hear what he said.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Justin Madders I am grateful to the right hon<prd> Member for raising this important point.	Labour Party	not_statement
It was touched on in Committee, but there are not any amendments dealing with that specific issue today.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Returning to holiday pay, where an employer does not keep adequate records, a Fair Work Agency enforcement officer may seek a labour market enforcement undertaking from the employer to ensure future compliance.	Labour Party	not_statement
Where the employer refuses to give a labour market enforcement undertaking, or fails to comply with one, the FWA enforcement officer may apply to the appropriate court for a labour market enforcement order.	Labour Party	not_statement
Chris Law (Dundee Central) (SNP) I apologise to the Minister because he has moved on, but I want to come back to the new level of statutory sick pay, which is £118<prd>75 or 80% of an employee’s weekly earnings.	Labour Party	not_statement
An employee with weekly earnings of £125 would at present get £116<prd>75, but under the new model, they would receive only £100.	Labour Party	not_statement
Is that correct?	Conservatives	not_statement
Justin Madders Yes, but the hon<prd> Member forgets the fact that we are removing the waiting days.	Conservative Party	not_statement
With the provisions on the lower earnings limit going, 1<prd>3 million people will be accessing statutory sick pay.	Labour Party	not_statement
Of course, it is something that we will always continue to review.	Conservatives	not_statement
Moving on to umbrella companies, we are aware of non-compliance in this market, where umbrella companies can be responsible for denying employment rights to those who work through them.	Labour Party	not_statement
New clause 36 will allow for the regulation of umbrella companies and for enforcement by the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, and subsequently the Fair Work Agency.	Labour Party	not_statement
The specific requirements on umbrella companies will be set out in the relevant regulations, which set out the minimum standards of conduct for employment agencies and employment businesses.	Labour Party	not_statement
We will consult before amending these regulations, and we are committed to working with the sector to ensure that future regulation works effectively for umbrella companies.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Government are moving a range of amendments in relation to part 3 of the Bill, which covers the adult social care negotiating body and the school support staff negotiating body.	Labour	not_statement
On the SSSNB, the Government are moving two technical amendments to correct incorrect cross-references.	Labour	not_statement
The body is an important part of delivering both the Government’s “Plan to Make Work Pay” and our opportunity mission.	Labour Party	not_statement
The Government will today commit to consult in the summer on whether agency workers should be brought into scope of the SSSNB in future legislation to support those missions.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Munira Wilson (Twickenham) (LD) Could the Minister clarify for the House whether the provisions on the school support staff negotiating body will provide a ceiling as well as a floor on pay, or will it just be a floor?	Conservative Party	not_statement
There are certainly a number of school and academy leaders who say they want to pay above what the Government might recommend for support staff and that this may limit them from doing so.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Justin Madders That was debated in detail in Committee.	Conservative Party	not_statement
My understanding is that there will be a floor, but there will not be a ceiling.	Conservative Party	not_statement
If I am wrong about that, I will come back to that.	Labour Party	not_statement
Amendments to the adult social care negotiating body provisions will remove clause 42, thereby removing the power to make stand-alone enforcement provision in respect of the agreements reached by negotiating body.	Labour	not_statement
Enforcement of pay terms under agreements will instead be in the remit of the new Fair Work Agency under schedule 4.	Labour Party	not_statement
Wendy Morton (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con) The Minister is rattling off a whole list of amendments that appear to have come after the legislation has gone through Committee.	Labour Party	not_statement
Justin Madders The reason why we are putting so many amendments down is because we have been consulting and working with businesses, and that is why we have so much to say today.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Sir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con) In that consultation, how many small businesses expressed their support for the Bill?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Justin Madders I refer the right hon<prd> Member to our departmental press release, where at least half a dozen business representatives and businesses have expressed support, and of course, there are many more businesses out there.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Indeed, I visited one only recently that supported the Bill.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Alison Griffiths (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con) Would the Minister be kind enough to name one of those businesses on the press release?	Conservative Party	not_statement
[Interruption.	Labour	not_statement
] He had better look at the press release just to check.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Justin Madders There is the Co-op—quite a big business—Richer Sounds, Centrica and the British Chambers of Commerce.	Labour Party	not_statement
These are not bit-part players at all, are they?	Labour Party	not_statement
New clause 38 seeks to ensure that agency workers in the adult social care sector who do not have a “worker’s contract”, within the meaning of employment legislation, would nevertheless be able to bring a claim in the employment tribunals or in civil proceedings where a fair pay agreement has been breached.	Labour Party	not_statement
It does that by deeming a contract to exist for this purpose between the worker and the party that pays them.	Labour Party	not_statement
New clause 37 and associated amendments will enable the Scottish and Welsh Ministers to establish their own separate negotiating bodies and associated framework, and to enable their negotiating bodies and the resulting agreements to cover social care workers in both adult and children’s social care.	Labour	not_statement
Care policy, funding and commissioning is delivered together in both Wales and Scotland.	Labour and Co-Operative Party	not_statement
In England, the two workforces, and therefore the policies and delivery, are distinct.	Labour Party	not_statement
Amendment 151 to clause 41 supplements the power to make regulations in relation to record keeping.	Labour Party	not_statement
14:00:00  Before winding up, I will address some other amendments.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I will take this opportunity to note the amendments tabled by my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Luton North (Sarah Owen).	Labour Party	not_statement
I am grateful to her Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.	Labour Party	not_statement
The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult and personal experience.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
I pay tribute to my hon<prd> Friend for showing great courage in talking about her personal experience of that.	Labour Party	not_statement
I am grateful to her and to other hon<prd> Members and campaigners for speaking about that issue—we have heard them.	Labour Party	not_statement
We fully accept the principle of bereavement leave for pregnancy loss, as addressed by the amendments.	Liberal Democrats	not_statement
We look forward to further discussions with my hon<prd> Friend and noble Lords as the Bill moves on to its stages in the other place.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I will also take this opportunity to note the new clauses tabled by my hon<prd> Friends the Members for Poplar and Limehouse (Apsana Begum) and for Lowestoft (Jess Asato).	Labour Party	not_statement
The Government recognise the important points raised by both hon<prd> Friends, and the serious impact that domestic abuse has on society, particularly on women and girls.	Labour Party	not_statement
We strongly encourage employers to support staff who experience domestic abuse.	Labour	not_statement
The Government have committed to halving violence against women and girls in a decade.	Labour Party	not_statement
I have met the Minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Birmingham Yardley (Jess Phillips), who is, as the House knows, a dedicated and respected campaigner on those issues.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I have also spoken to several Members about their concerns, including my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Gloucester (Alex McIntyre), whose private Member’s Bill—the Domestic Abuse (Safe Leave) Bill—has been given its First Reading; my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Lowestoft; and the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Alex Davies-Jones).	Conservative Party	not_statement
Members shared many powerful stories from their constituents.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Every part of Government will need to contribute towards our ambition.	Labour Party	not_statement
Jerome Mayhew (Broadland and Fakenham) (Con) When my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Alison Griffiths) asked a moment ago which businesses support the Bill, the Minister mentioned the British Chambers of Commerce.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I have just visited its website, which states:  “The British Chambers of Commerce has used an evidence session on the Employment Rights Bill to highlight businesses’ serious concerns about the legislation and the speed and detail of consultation.	Labour Party	not_statement
”  Will the Minister withdraw his comment?	Labour Party	not_statement
Justin Madders I am glad that the hon<prd> Member has access to the internet.	Labour Party	not_statement
I direct him to the Department’s webpage, where he will see that Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said:  “There is much here to welcome as sensible moves that will help ensure that employment works for both the business and the individual”.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That was in response to the amendments, so it is a much more up-to-date comment than the one the hon<prd> Member mentioned.	Labour Party	not_statement
Returning to the important issue of violence against women and girls, it is incumbent on every part of Government to work together to tackle violence against women and girls.	Labour Party	not_statement
That is not a task for a single Department or Minister.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Government are steadfastly committed to delivering our manifesto commitment to halving violence against women and girls, and we will publish a cross-Government strategy shortly.	Labour	not_statement
I intend to work with colleagues to ensure that our Department does its bit in that respect.	Conservatives	not_statement
I also take this opportunity to note the amendments tabled by my right hon<prd> Friend the Member for Sheffield Heeley (Louise Haigh) and the hon<prd> Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran) on non-disclosure agreements.	Labour Party	not_statement
I have met advocates on that issue and I understand the significant problems that they have highlighted in relation to the misuse of non-disclosure agreements in some circumstances.	Labour Party	not_statement
That important issue warrants further consideration.	Labour Party	not_statement
We take NDA misuse seriously and will continue to look into it to see what we can do.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Sir Julian Smith (Skipton and Ripon) (Con) New clause 72, in the name of the hon<prd> Member for Leeds Central and Headingley (Alex Sobel), focuses on whistleblowing and protected disclosures.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That area has been so important in recent public scandals, including the Post Office-Fujitsu scandal and the Lucy Letby case.	Conservative Party	not_statement
May I urge the Minister to consider that new clause?	Conservative Party	not_statement
Employment Rights Bill: Employment Rates  Paul Holmes (Hamble Valley) (Con) 4.	UK Government	not_statement
Whether she has had discussions with the Secretary of State for Business and Trade on the potential impact of the Employment Rights Bill on employment rates.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The Minister for Employment (Alison McGovern) I meet regularly with Business and Trade Ministers.	Labour Party	not_statement
We are committed to working with businesses to ensure that policy is pro-employer and pro-worker.	Labour Party	not_statement
In fact, since I have been at the DWP, I have found that employers have not had sufficient contact from jobcentres and only one in six employers think about using them.	Conservative Party	not_statement
That is what a real growth agenda looks like from DWP.	Labour Party	not_statement
Deirdre Costigan (Ealing Southall) (Lab) Lá Fhéile Pádraig Sona Duit—a happy St Patrick’s day to you, Mr Speaker, and all your team.	Parliament	not_statement

Employment Rights Bill  Debate resumed.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Gregory Stafford It is always a pleasure to follow the King.	Conservative Party	not_statement
[Laughter.	Conservative Party	not_statement
] Nothing has highlighted more clearly than this debate the old adage that where we think the Labour party is wrong, it thinks that we are evil.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
Nothing that has come from Labour Members has given any consideration to the absolutely correct concerns that the shadow Minister, my hon<prd> Friend the Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith), raised in his opening remarks.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Even the Government’s own impact assessment, which Opposition Members have mentioned on a number of occasions, concedes that business will face a staggering £5 billion in additional costs: an economic straitjacket that will choke innovation and job creation.	Labour Party	not_statement
Labour Members seem to have failed to realise that being pro-business, as the Conservatives are, is being pro-worker, because if businesses do not exist there will be no one to employ workers.	Labour Party	not_statement
In my constituency alone we have over 5,000 businesses, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises.	Conservatives	not_statement
Many of them operate in the education, retail and hospitality sectors, which rely on flexibility to survive, Lincoln Jopp (Spelthorne) (Con) Gregory Stafford My hon<prd> Friend makes a good point.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I think of the University for the Creative Arts students who rely on flexible work and the NHS paramedic in Farnham picking up extra shifts at the Nelson Arms, as I mentioned earlier.	Conservatives	not_statement
UKHospitality has been clear that for 90% of workers on zero-hours contracts, that is their preference.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The sector relies on these contracts to manage fluctuating demand, and removing that flexibility could devastate those businesses and lead to job losses.	Labour Party	not_statement
There is no job security for those who do not have a job.	Labour Party	not_statement
Similarly, the right to request flexible working must be assessed properly.	UK Government	not_statement
Madam Deputy Speaker, I fear the clock may not have started for my speech, so I will draw to a close.	Scottish National Party	not_statement

This Government seem to have learned nothing from history.	Labour Party	not_statement
We have heard history lessons from Government Members, most of which have seemed to take us back to the 1970s.	Labour Party	not_statement
Economic success does not come from shackling businesses with red tape or giving trade unions unchecked power.	Labour Party	not_statement
It comes from fostering an environment where employers can hire, invest and grow.	Labour	not_statement

Alison Bennett (Mid Sussex) (LD) Carers UK estimates that the value to the economy of carers being able to work is £5<prd>3 billion.	Liberal Democrats	not_statement
When I have met major blue-chip employers such as Centrica and HSBC, and their employees who have benefited from those corporations’ carers policies, The 2<prd>8 million people who juggle a job and caring responsibilities are going above and beyond to care for those they love while also contributing to our economy.	Liberal Democrats	not_statement
We must acknowledge their work with a fair deal for them.	Labour Party	not_statement
I know that this is something the carers in my constituency deserve.	Liberal Democrats	not_statement
They deserve better.	Scottish National Party	not_statement
We must be adaptable to the changing needs of our population while also seeing the benefits.	Labour Party	not_statement
This really can be a win-win.	Liberal Democrats	not_statement
We know that being a carer makes people much more likely to fall into poverty.	Labour Party	not_statement
Carers UK’s research also tells us that almost half of all those who left employment early to fulfil a caring responsibility say that they would have stayed in employment longer, had carer’s leave on a paid basis existed.	Liberal Democrats	not_statement
Mrs Russell I need to highlight to the House that I am a member of the Community and USDAW trade unions, and I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.	Conservative Party	not_statement
I would like to speak to various bits of this legislation today.	Labour Party	not_statement
There is so much in it, and I know that so many of us on the Government Back Benches are really pleased with what we are bringing forward.	Labour Party	not_statement
The first part of the legislation that I want to address is clause 22, which will bring forward in future legislation more protections for women who are pregnant, on maternity leave and in the period immediately following their maternity leave.	Labour Party	not_statement
I have spent the past 13 years representing large numbers of women who were either made redundant while pregnant, on maternity leave or trying to come back from maternity leave, or whose employer suddenly woke up one morning and decided that they were underperforming, often within 24 hours of their announcing their pregnancy.	Labour	not_statement
I had a client who had been headhunted and brought into the company, was totally stellar, doing incredibly well and got promoted, but then announced her pregnancy and within a week she was on a performance plan.	Labour Party	not_statement
HR explained to her that because they were, you know, kind and did not want to do that to her while she was pregnant, they were very generously offering her a settlement agreement so that she did not have to go through that.	Labour Party	not_statement
Lots of perfectly decent people do not understand why they are losing their jobs, and it is because they are pregnant.	Labour Party	not_statement
Pregnant Then Screwed found that 12<prd>3% of women who have had a baby have either been sacked, constructively dismissed or made redundant while pregnant, on maternity leave or within a year of their maternity leave ending.	Labour Party	not_statement
Lola McEvoy My hon<prd> Friend, who has great expertise in this area, is making an eloquent speech.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The second element I like in the legislation is the improvements to the right to request flexible working.	Conservatives	not_statement
Those on the Conservative Benches have questioned why we would do this.	Labour Party	not_statement
Conservative Members have talked a lot about clause 17 and the third-party harassment elements, and it is worth getting into some of the detail.	Conservative Party	not_statement
The defence for an employer for failing to protect their staff from third-party harassment is taking all reasonable steps to prevent that harassment from occurring.	Labour	not_statement
Employment tribunals have been interpreting the meaning of “reasonable” for a long time, and in a discrimination claim there is essentially a three-part judiciary: a judge with legal experience, someone with employer experience, and someone with employee experience—sometimes from a trade union, but sometimes from elsewhere.	Labour Party	not_statement
Wera Hobhouse The hon<prd> Member is speaking powerfully.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Mrs Russell I completely and utterly agree with the hon<prd> Member.	Conservative Party	not_statement
Actually, a lot of what is coming from Conservative Members is scaremongering.	Conservative Party	not_statement
